1,5.0 out of 5 stars Quality product at a much lower cost.,I have tried more expensive makeup fixatives and this is equal to any of the more expensive products. I particularly like the fine mist and the fact that it doesn't have much odor. Thanks for a great product at such a reasonable price!

4,3.0 out of 5 stars Does not last a full Eight hours,"I used this product immediately after receiving. I sprayed on both sides of my face and purposely left my forehead shiny and oily. 2hours later I checked my face and both sides of my face had a matte finish and my forehead was still shiny and oily. 6 hours later both sides of my face lost the matte finish. So, it did not last a full 8 hrs. Does not work for me.

14,5.0 out of 5 stars Nice for price but VERY bronze.,"It doesn’t take much of this product to give my fair skin a bronze glow, even after building a decent tan. First time I used it I put a few drops of this with no lotion and it was way too dark, but now I just put a drop or 2 in my face moisturizer and it gives me a lovely glow. Almost too warm for my cool skin but it looks good nonetheless! Never tried the drunk elephant drops but from what I can tell this seems relatively comparable and you can’t beat the price.

27,5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite liquid liner.,"I’ve been using this liquid liner for at least the last 10 years or more and I always get the same one! I’ve tried so many others in between Just to see, but for me, this is the best one! It’s so easy to hold to put it on, and it goes on so clean but still dark.

28,5.0 out of 5 stars Been buying this eyeliner since the early 2000's.,"It used to be called ""Amazing i-Liner"". I've tried other eyeliners over the years in a genuine effort to move on from this product, but they don't seem to do it for me like this does. I do believe the formula has changed, as it does take reapplication of the eyeliner to get an opaque look. While it's labeled hypoallergenic and no doubt it is, I notice fresh bottles tend to sting but leave no irritation on the skin. The applicator tip also is pretty stiff at first but once you break it in — it does work beautifully. Here's why I've kept buying this eyeliner for over 20 years: 1. A true matte finish. I've purchased  ""matte"" eyeliners that have end up having a semi-gloss finish, or a weird sticky flakey texture. My theory is because these products attempt to waterproof the formula which sacrifice that flat matte finish. While unfortunately this Almay eyeliner isn't waterproof and therefore not smudgeproof — there's nothing a little finishing spray or eyeshadow primer can't do. I've used both with great results during swimming and gym workouts. In my opinion, I love the true matte black and don't mind it doesn't have those other properties built into to it. 2. A fantastic felt tip applicator. Something about the shape, material, length, and absorbency of this applicator works perfectly for my hooded eyelids. There are $20+ high-end eyeliners that just don't get right what this $7 drugstore eyeliner can do. Some felt tips are too long and therefore hard to control, some are a thin brush which doesn't hold as much product in one swipe. If you want to avoid breaking in the felt tip and the roughness that comes at first, I recommend just squeezing the felt tip between your fingers and gently bend it around to soften it a bit more. 3. A long-lasting amount of product. You'd be surprised how long that little ""ink well"" of eyeliner can last you! Usually the felt tip applicator is the first to go (after a long while of usage) before you actually run out of product. I like that Almay has kept this element of their eyeliner consistent over the years. Those are my 2 cents. Definitely will continue to buy this for years to come. :) Read more",02 Nov 2023,C.

31,4.0 out of 5 stars Magic staying power!,"I love the staying power of this eyeliner and I've bought it over and over. I've got greasy eyelids and work 12-hour shifts- so my eye make up needs to last 13 hours or so AND be able to stand up to my oil, plus hot and sweaty conditions sometimes. Have I mentioned that I’m a nurse?  So it’s awesome if I somehow manage to look a little professional too!  This little pot of eyeliner never lets me down! It's easy to apply and easy enough to correct with a wet cotton swab for a couple minutes after application.  After that, well, you’re going to have to take it off and start over I think.  This eyeliner isn’t perfect and doesn’t quite make it the whole 13 hours sometimes.  Sometimes I’ll get home and notice that I’ve dragged a bit of eyeliner down my face and occasionally I notice that one eye has a bit less than the other.  However, I’ve never found another eyeliner that gets closer to what I need, and I’ve tried plenty.  This really is a great little eyeliner.  I’m taking 1 star off because sometimes my eyelids burn with the initial application and if I wipe off the eyeliner I can see that my eyelid is also bright pink where it was applied.  The burning doesn’t last for more than a second or two, and I don’t have further irritation throughout the day.  I do an oil cleanser at the end of the day and it comes off easily.

38,5.0 out of 5 stars Best natural looking eyeshadow ever,"I am nearing 40 and the skin around my eyes is not nearly as tight or firm anymore. I have a lot more creases and my eyelids look noticeably more hooded than when I was younger. I really feel like the natural colors and shading from this palette make my eyes look more youthful and brighter (comparison photos attached of me with no eye makeup vs using this eyeshadow and some mascara). These are truly matte and create flattering, natural shadows of color even when you're over 24.  I've been using it for a couple months now and it never settles in fine lines or creases and I never felt like it makes me look older than I am (which pretty much every other eyeshadow has made me feel). I am not an expert at makeup by any means, nor do I have the time or desire to watch makeup tutorials so I just completely wing it. The brushes on my photo are placed over the colors I use for my ""natural"" look (the lighter brown for eyeshadow and liner on my bottom lashes and the darker brown for eyeliner on my top lid). These initially go on super light, even on my pale skin, but you can very easily build up the color with another pass of your brush to meet your desired hue. You could make these more bold than what I’ve shown, just by adding a couple more swipes of powder if you wanted to. It is also easy to wipe off, which is great for me since I often mess up - but not great for you if you’re someone who frequently rubs your eyes or something like that. It does have decent staying power, but about halfway through the day I notice it fading away. However, when I say fading away that’s really what I mean. It does not start to fall into creases or flake or anything like that. It just starts to disappear. Every other eyeshadow I’ve tried also doesn’t last all day, but it looks worse and worse as the day goes on. This still looks good even as it starts to fade. I don’t like to spend much time on my makeup, but I think my eyes are my best feature and I like to draw a little attention to them for a little confidence boost. After a bit of practice, it now only takes me a few minutes to swipe this on along with my favorite brown mascara (also in the photo) to enhance my eyes and it’s time well spent in my book. This powder really is perfect for my wants and I’m so happy I found it! I absolutely would recommend it. Hope this helps you decide if this product might work for you too!

50,,"Ich liebe die Lidschatten-Paletten von W7. Zuvor besaß ich schon die ""In The Buff"" Palette, doch die ist nun so gut wie aufgebraucht. Daher bestellte ich mir zum ersten Mal die ""Mighty Mattes"" Palette und ich finde sie wirklich extrem schön! Lauter Nude Töne, von Rosa bis Braun. Bis auf den leicht schimmernden und glutzernden Rosa-Ton, alle Farben matt gehalten. Auch im Auftrag ist die Farbabgabe zufriedenstellend. Lieferzeit war exakt wie angegeben. Die Palette wirkt relativ stabil und hochwertig und sieht aus, wie auf den Fotos. Daher gibt es nichts Negatives zu sagen und ich kann eine klare Kaufempfehlung für dieses Produkt (generell für die Lidschattenpaletten von W7) abgeben, da das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis überragend ist! :) Read more",25 Jul 2017,RominiBini,,B01N6WMQ9Y,"https://www.amazon.com/W7-Eyeshadow-Long-lasting-Transition-Cruelty-free/dp/B01N6WMQ9Y/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

51,5.0 out of 5 stars Colorgram lip glass tint Satisfied Fig,"I ordered this for my GF and here is her review: I had never heard of this brand but was intrigued by the description and wanted to try it out. I am thoroughly impressed! From the moment I applied it, I knew I had stumbled upon something special. First and foremost, the application is a breeze. The design of the applicator allows for precise and easy control, making it simple to achieve an even coat without any mess. I appreciate that it glides on smoothly, which is often a challenge with other lip products. One of the beneficial features of this lip tint is its long-lasting formula. I applied it in the morning, and it remained vibrant for several hours, even through meals and drinks. The color payoff is decent; it delivers a rich hue that doesn’t fade quickly and provides that perfect pop of color to brighten up any look. The texture is another highlight. The satiny feel is luxurious on the lips—hydrating without being tacky or sticky, which can often be the case with lip glosses. Instead, it feels comfortable and lightweight, allowing me to forget I’m even wearing it. What I truly like is the buildable nature of the tint. You can easily layer it for a more intense color, or keep it sheer for a subtle wash. This versatility means I can wear it for any occasion, whether I want a bold statement or a casual day look. Overall, I am so satisfied with this lip glass tint that I'm already looking forward to trying out more colors from the range. It has quickly become a staple in my makeup collection, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.

52,"4.0 out of 5 stars Very Bright, Vibrant Pink That Stains Well","This is a very comfortable, watery, non-drying, and non-sticky tint. It's a little hard to apply evenly because of how thin it is because I personally don't use this color all over my lips but don't want it to look patchy either. It has a bit of a chemical-y smell that's also mixed with what I'm assuming is peach? But once applied you don't smell it at all.  This shade specifically is a very very vibrant, almost cool-toned hot pink. I've put the website image of it on here too so you can see. Once it's on your lips, you don't feel it at all, especially if you blend/blot it out with your finger. I honestly forgot I had a tint on my lips. And the stain! It stains so beautifully so the color stays on for a while. I blended this out with my fingers since the pink is a bit too hot pink for me and the stain is still on my fingers even after washing and rubbing at it with a napkin. If you're warmer toned or want a bit more of a coral-y pink, their Dewy Grapefruit is GORGEOUS and my personal favorite of the few I've tried.

53,5.0 out of 5 stars Great,"The COLORGRAM Fruity Glass Gloss in 01 Grape Black is an interesting take on lip gloss for those looking to add a unique, glass-like shine to their makeup routine. The gloss delivers a non-sticky, smooth finish, making it comfortable to wear without that heavy or sticky feeling that many lip glosses can have. The ""Grape Black"" shade offers a subtle tint that enhances your natural lip color with a cool, dark, and slightly purple undertone, perfect for adding a touch of drama or sophistication to your look. One of the standout features is the hydrating formula. This gloss keeps your lips feeling moisturized and smooth for hours, which is a bonus if you tend to experience dryness. The long-lasting effect ensures that you don’t need to constantly reapply, and the glossy, glass-like finish stays vibrant throughout the day. However, the ""Grape Black"" shade, while unique, might not be for everyone. The color payoff is semi-sheer, so if you’re looking for something bold, you may need to layer it over a darker lipstick to achieve a more intense look. Additionally, because it’s a gloss, it may need a touch-up after meals or extended wear. Overall, the COLORGRAM Fruity Glass Gloss 01 Grape Black is a great pick for those who love non-sticky, glossy finishes with a subtle, chic tint. It’s especially suitable for anyone looking to add hydration and shine to their lips with a hint of color.

54,5.0 out of 5 stars A nice glossy tint that adds a subtle cool pink tone to the lips and lasts several hours,"I recieved this lip tint in the shade 14 - Sulky Lychee. This shade is a cool-toned pink, and is very sheer, blending in with your natural lip color and enhancing it, adding some shine as well. The lip tint packaging is also quite cute and aesthetically pleasing, and while the packaging isn't the most important thing, the component is cute and goes with the other Colorgram products in their lineup. Lip tints are my preferred lip product, and this Colorgram lip tint delivers on certain things I look for in a glossy tint: it's thin and comfortable on the lips, it doesn't migrate or move from where I've applied it, and it gives me a natural looking kiss of color to my lips that lasts without me worrying about reapplying it often. This shade in particular would look nice with a cool toned cream blush for a natural no makeup-makeup sort of look. It's comfortable on the lips and the shine lasts a couple of hours, with the color payoff persisting once the shine has worn off from the lips. If you're neutral to cool toned this shade would likely work well for you!

55,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good pigment, very drying","I love a lot about this tint; the packaging is super cute (which I appreciate because I like to display my makeup on my vanity), and it's very smooth and well-pigmented. I didn't love the shade (Shy Pear) as much as I had hoped; it's a bit more dull and brown than I hoped. However, I think it would be pretty on the right skin tone. My only complaint is that the formula seems to be drying so far. I didn't love how it felt on my lips, and they felt pretty dry after I took it off.  Still, this seems to be a common issue with lip tints, and I think for the value, this is a good product.

Cons: - the shade 04 Sulking Watermelon is NOT flattering on my mauvey/earthy toned lips. it's extremely bright pink upon application and dries off to be VERY pink on my lips - like other reviewers, I also felt like the formula was very drying on my lips - the dryness made the color patchy, even on my hydrated lips :( Read more",23 Oct 2024,Geyser Meyser,3.0,B0DC9C1PWF,"https://www.amazon.com/COLORGRAM-FRUITY-WATER-TINT-JUJUBE/dp/B0DC9C1PWF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

67,"5.0 out of 5 stars Definitely good for an ""on a budget"" real life scenario....","Im almost 50 so finding makeup that works even in the slightest is difficult. I use elf primer(sometimes loreal primer), let that dry, apply my No. 7, then apply this under my eyes, and upper cheek areas. It holds up well even in the rain which was surprising. I would definitely buy this again. I pat it on with my finger or a brush blender and it blends out beautifully. I wouldn't say it is greasy or too thick. Also, you do not have to use a lot of it, which is a good change. It is a very good value for the money! I actually have busted veins and blemishes all over my cheeks, but you can't tell too much when I use this so I would definitely buy this again! I have combination skin where I am oily around my nose, but the outer portions of my face are dry. And I found that I like this because it doesn't make it too matte looking or it doesn't look super dry under my eyes. That's what i've been having problems with. When it comes to concealers, for me, they would get very matte and dry looking. Or they would be so greasy that when I touch my eyes and touch something else, it would leave makeup residue, and I can't stand that! Good value!

68,3.0 out of 5 stars Works okay.,"Revlon ColorStay Flex Wear, Full Cover Non-Creasing Concealer, Infused with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E, Flexible Longwear, 055 Latte, 0.34 fl oz. ($12.99) I do not consider this full coverage.  It is medium coverage.  It is creamy, which is nice.  Looks so nice when first applied.  Staying power isn't there even when I set it with powder.  It does crease some also.  I was looking forward to this concealer but it did not perform as well as I had hoped.  L'Oréal Infallible Full Wear Waterproof Concealer and L’Oréal Paris True Match Radiant Serum Concealer work loads better.

87,,"This skin care set is very much underrated. First of all, the product bottles are very sturdy and don’t leak everywhere, the colour coded bottles are great and fits the theme. This is a great set for tweens or teens, as the natural fruit extracts and milder skin ingredients are best suited for young skin( because let’s face it what tween needs to shop skincare in Sephora?!- and what tween really needs all those harsher treatments and products, I mean any more smoother skin and they might at well get back in the womb. Rant over let’s get back to the review, so the smell of this set is amazing, you can actually smell the different fruit scents in each bottle, the formulas itself is wonderful, my daughter loves it, having also tried this I can confirm that it does help to lock in moisture and cleanses skin well without being drying. The watermelon cream is a dream, so silky and face feels very hydrated. The pineapple enzyme serum equally dyes the same but with the added benefit of adding a glow which makes the skin feel and look refreshed and bright. My daughter uses it daily and it hasn’t caused any irritation so perfect for people with sensitive and tweens/ teens. Overall a real winner, and the will be ordering more most definitely.

108,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great hydration boost, noticeable softening over time","I’ve been using this product for a few weeks now and I can definitely see why it’s so popular. The texture is smooth and it glides on easily without leaving any sticky residue, which I love. The packaging is also sleek and compact which makes it perfect for tossing in my bag. In terms of results I’ve definitely noticed my skin feels softer and more hydrated after each use. It doesn’t magically erase wrinkles overnight, but with consistent use there’s definitely a clear difference. I also like that it layers well with other products in my skincare routine. One thing to note is that it’s on the pricier side for a small amount, but a little goes a long way. I would definitely say this product is worth it for a gentile daily boost to keep skin hydrated and smooth.

110,4.0 out of 5 stars Dewy glow,"I LOVE that this gives a soft dewy glow. It has a pleasant rosy smell to me. It does feel a bit sticky on my skin, but I only apply it to just on top of my cheekbones and if my collarbone is exposed. Once it has absorbed into the skin it feels soft and hydrated. Definitely will buy again! I wanted to come back several months later to add more to my review. The product is a good value for the money as it lasts quite a long time. I still have my original purchase. As I said before, I add it like a highlighter to add a bit of shine at the top of my cheekbones and collarbone. It is glossy and wet looking at first, but once the skin absorbs it in there is an effect of a glow from within. I've found when younger (gen x) we were pushed to make our oily teen skin look matte to appear more mature, but now that we are this recreates that youthful luminosity to the skin precisely where it is applied. I've also put this under my eyes and noticed a reduction in puffiness, but definitely apply it a bit before you need it to give it time to absorb.  I get compliments on my skin almost every time I wear it.

112,3.0 out of 5 stars It’s nice but not amazing,"I bought this on an Amazon deal day. It’s supposed to be all the rage in Korea.  There aren’t instructions for the best way to use it.  I looked something up online.  It says to apply after your normal skincare routine.  It feels nice going on.  Does it improve the wrinkles or skin tone?  Not so much.  The most I think it does it give you a little shine, but my skin isn’t super dry.  I bought one for under my eyes, too, because my skin there is crepey.  I think it helps a bit more there.  Makes applying my concealer easier! I’m using each stick daily, but I probably won’t buy them again. Read more",09 Nov 2024,S. G.

113,5.0 out of 5 stars It's Addictive,"I'm really enjoying this wrinkle bounce multi stick. Makes my skin so soft but not so sure about my wrinkles. I don't fund it sticky at all as a matter of fact it's really slick! Seems like quality stuff and has a light fragrance.  I'm unsure about all the salmon stuff in it as I haven't done any research on it but I do really enjoy putting it on my face, it's like habit forming. I wish it came with more in it like maybe the size of the old Bonnie Bell Lip slackers did. This is smaller than that. I'm wondering now about the other salves in the line. I might try the purple one for eyes next. Oh, and not sure about putting it on your lips. I read you can and then I read not to.

114,5.0 out of 5 stars Works great,"I bought this Kahi multi balm with the recommendation of my good co worker. She has been using it for a while and has a nice glowing and glass skin. So I did try it and surely did not dissappoint. I used to have melasma, dry and dull skin. After few weeks of consistently using it, the melasma fades away. My skin feels smoother and healthier. It is also a very good lip moisturizer. Just don't over apply as it can be a bit greasy. Overall its a must have.

134,5.0 out of 5 stars OMG THE SMELL 🤤 Don’t let the negative reviews scare you!,"Holy smokes, Batman! These products smells DELICIOUS!! I seriously feel like I’m inside of a candy store or a cold stone creamery - simply just SMELLING these! No sooner did I open the box, I could smell the products. I didn’t even have to take the bubble wrap off or open them!! While extremely unfortunate for those unlucky ladies who purchased these products, & received poorly packaged/filled goods, every thing I purchased came full to the brim & completely intact!

I’m so happy I took the risk, even after reading the reviews (I dug hella deep into them mind you) & decided to purchase the 6 item package! I’d give Truly 10 stars if Amazon allowed it!!!

138,4.0 out of 5 stars Refreshing and Effective Body Care Kit,"The Truly Beauty Full Body Skin Care Kit is a refreshing addition to my skincare routine. The body exfoliator included in the kit is particularly effective. It gently buffs away dead skin cells, leaving my skin feeling smooth and rejuvenated. The formula is gentle enough for regular use. While I'm impressed with the overall quality and effectiveness of the products, I docked one star because I found the scent of some products to be a bit overpowering. However, this is a minor issue and doesn't take away significantly from the overall experience. Overall, the Truly Beauty Full Body Skin Care Kit is a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to elevate their body care routine with vegan and effective products.

145,5.0 out of 5 stars Skincare Staple For a Reason,"I keep coming back to this unassuming cleanser every time my skin gets the winter blues. For reference: I have oily, combination, with dry patches (overusing tretinoin 0.1) skin and I love heavy skincare during cold days that you can actually feel on your skin like a fuzzy blanket vs the jelly texture creams that soak into my skin and don’t add extra moisture and protection to the dermis. So I use Embryolisse lait crème concentre and about 3 years ago tried this cleanser as I felt that skin was getting more mature (32) and less oily, add all the torture and assault I’ve put it through the years of peelings, scrubs, masks, questionable treatments and recently tretinoin, so I started switching to gentler products, taking a page from French skincare routine, the gentler and simpler—the better. I randomly picked this cleanser because it’s one of the top dermatologist-recommended cleansers for sensitive skin. I tried it for a few days and I HATED it, it has no suds, no lather, no squeaky feeling. So I did with it what I did with other hated products—I put it onto the corner of my bathtub, behind the shower curtain, where all of my unused or hated product went, before eventually, going into the trash can. But, after a year or so I decided to give it another try after seeing the outpouring love for the product from YouTube derms. And I decided to actually give it a try. Because you know, your skin goes through cycles and every cycle (skin cell turnover) is about 3 weeks, so when starting a new product give it a few weeks to work unless you have allergic reaction, you should stop immediately. After trying a few weeks I loved it, my skin got used to it and while using tretinoin and light peeling treatments my skin never felt better. It would get very oily at first but my glands eventually adjusted and produced less sebum. My skin felt so clean and soft, no need to jump out of shower to slab cream on my face before it fully dries and feels like Sahara Desert. It really adds that extra layer of moisture and protection to your skin that I know my skin can use during the colder months. I never had any breakouts while using it or irritations. It soothes my tret abused skin and heals it overnight. The only thing about this product you should remember, it doesn’t remove makeup, I use doable-cleansing always so it doesn’t bother me. I usually use a cleansing oil, then wash it off, pat a little dry so I can work this cleansing cream throughly and it feels heavenly. I’m used to it now not lathering and I’m fine with it. You can massage you face while you’re cleaning it and give yourself a mini spa treatment, it’s worthwhile and never will irritate your skin. I’m a convert believer!

To be fair, I've tried many, many brands of mousse and there is only one store brand available nowadays that actually makes and holds volume. The good things about this mousse is that it comes in a glass bottle, has a pump, and that pump has a plastic piece you can use to lock the pump. The mousse smells like grass (the kind you mow, not maryjane lol) which isn't totally unpleasant. The product doesn't give my hair enough volume to recommend. Read more",04 Sep 2024,P.

169,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good for my texture, mildly volumizing","The media could not be loaded. This mousse is practically unscented. Apparently, the formula contains all natural ingredients ""all grown in the rain forest"", not sure how would that be related to the effectiveness or quality of it... I love that it comes in a glass bottle and I can see the content, and the dispenser pump works ok. For a palm full dose I would need like 4 to 5 pumps, because the foam is not very thick. However, this product is not sticky at all, and it is super easy to spread. Since the instructions for this product are so laconic, I decided to try it in two different ways: for a natural air dry look, and for a bouncy blowout. Keep in mind, I have no idea about what level of hold is expected for the volume, and even less info about heat protection. Note: mine is long, medium coarse/wavy hair. Here's what I did: For the air dry look: used in combination with a spray leave-in conditioner only, I wanted to keep it as lightweight as possible. Results: I noticed that the mousse enhanced my natural wavy texture and left no residual stickiness. My hair was as soft as if I hadn't used anything on it. But, on the other hand, it didn't make any difference at all on the volume, and I saw no effect on the shine or frizz. I concluded that this is not my best choice for my natural look. For the blowout look: I used it in combination with a leave-in conditioner (this time I used one with UV and Heat protection) and a blowout cream. My tool: I chose a 2in1 volumizer hot air brush. Results: there was a mild increased volume towards the front and crown sections, barely noticeable today, after 24 hours post styling. Again, not much difference in the shine, compared to not using the mousse. I am sure my results could be affected by my technique and the weight of my very long hair. Maybe I could have seen more texture if I used a diffuser for curls; or maybe I should try this product with traditional rollers. Perhaps this lightweight formula will be better for people with very thin or short hair. I hope my experiment helps others as reference.

176,1.0 out of 5 stars DO NOT BUY!! YOUR HAIR WILL FALL OUT,"Do not buy this product! The hair that the company claims will grow will all be on the floor of your shower. I shampoo and I had lost more hair than normal. The shampoo does not foam. The conditioner doesn’t make your hair feel smooth. I also used the spray after the shower. I blow dried my hair as normal and something was not right about my hair. It felt like straw. Not smooth and sleek like my normal shampoo and conditioner. I didn’t read the one star reviews prior to purchase. Shame on me. However after seeing others describe hair loss I went back to the shower, washed my hair again with my normal shampoo and conditioner. I don’t want any of these products in my hair ever again. You will be wasting money if you buy this and not only will your money be gone…… your hair will be too.

182,,"Anfangs fühlte sich das Haar nach dem Shampoonieren tatsächlich ungewohnt an. Vergleichbar wie nach einer Verwendung mit tiefenreinigendem Shampoo, verschwindet aber nach der Verwendung mit dem Conditoner wieder. Ich nutze es seit Ende Juni, zwischenzeitlich hatte ich noch mal gewechselt, um Restbestände anderer Marken aufzubrauchen. Mein Haar fühlt sich aber seit der Verwendung mit Moerie wesentlich gesünder an. Es glänzt auch schön. Ich bin zufrieden. Was das Haarwachstum betrifft: kann sein, dass das Haar dadurch etwas schneller in den vier Monaten gewachsen ist. Ich war in dem Zeitraum nicht mehr beim Friseur.

183,,"Ich habe die Produkte jeden Tag der Reihe nach verwendet. Zum Schampoo: Ja ich kann 100% bestätigen, was viele andere Nutzer schreiben: Es macht die Haare beim Waschen sehr strohig, was sich unangenehm anfühlt. Ohne Conditioner hat man keine Chance sich ohne Widerstand mit den Händen durch die nassen Haare zu fahren. Der Geruch von den Produkten ist leicht zitronig, was mich nicht gestört hat -da dezent. Ich habe das Spray welches den Haarwuchs boosten soll auch immer angewendet und muss sagen, für diesen extrem teuren Preis ist das Ergebnis echt eine richtig fette Enttäuschung.

I use the hair mask weekly and it is AMAZING. I also love the Multi Miracle spray. I use just a bit of it before blow drying to protect my hair from the heat. I am so happy I found these products!

194,5.0 out of 5 stars LOVE,"AIIR Jade Hair Oil OK - When I first tried this serum I wasn't paying attention and used 2 pumps and without thinking just put it all through my hair.  After I did that, I thought OMG - what did I do?  I am going to have an oily mess,  Well, I just decided to blow dry as normal and hope for the best.  I HAD THE BEST HAIR DAY. I have shoulder-length fine hair that is pretty straight and I normally use an iron after blow drying but i didn't need one at all.  I had volume and a bit of texture.  It was shiny and soft.  It doesn't not feel sticky or greasy at all. I used it again with only one pump and got even better results.  My hair stayed nice and I did end up using a flat iron and it looked even better,  This is amazing.  I really love this and the Diamond Shampoo and Conditioner from this brand. It is my new favorite.

195,5.0 out of 5 stars Already in Love!,"So I've used the AIIR Jade Hair Oil for the past few days, and I adore it.  I use hair oil every single time I wash my hair.  I have long, fine, thick-ish hair, that tends to tangle easily.  The first thing I do after I condition it is to dry it with a towel, and then massage hair oil through it.  I allow it to air dry a tiny bit, then comb through it. This oil is great.  My hair feels soft and bouncy!  The oil doesn't weigh my hair down at all.  It's light.  The oil doesn't look greasy or leave any type of noticeable film or heaviness, either.  I don't put that much in, though.  I use about one pump, then rub my hands together.  I then take separate sections of my hair and massage the oil into the sections.  That seems to give just enough for the hair to absorb a bit of oil. I was worried I didn't use enough oil, but I could comb my hair easily (then I worried I used too much!).  It was fine; when my hair dried, it was soft and silky.  I lightly curled it and it was full of body. Highly recommended.

196,"4.0 out of 5 stars Expensive, needs a seal, but good oil","I have very thick, dense, waist length hair, so I'm always on the lookout for great oils. I'm outdoors in extreme heat for several hours a day, so it really wreaks havoc on my hair. I was really excited to try this as I'd heard good things about it. It's very pricey for the amount you get, so I took off a star. There isn't anything special enough in the ingredients to justify the price. I do like that it's jade infused and has bayleaf, though, as these are unique. The bottle also needs a seal of some sort. When it arrived, the cap was loose in the package, the product leaked, and the cap had a crack so it won't stay on very well. A seal of some sort likely would have prevented this. At this price point, if I'm a paying customer, I would expect to receive all that I paid for. So, I took off another star. That said, it's a great oil. It has a ""slippery"" quality, which I really like because it's easier to distribute through my hair. A little goes a longer way than with other products. It has a very light, barely discernible natural herbal scent. It's pleasant, and light enough that it dissipates quickly, and doesn't clash with any other fragrance products I'm wearing. My hair is left silky and soft, without any greasiness or heaviness. Overall, this is a fantastic product. I really wish I could give it 5 stars. Lower the price to <$30, and add a seal, and it would be an easy 5 stars.

197,5.0 out of 5 stars Oil that adds luster and softness!,"Pretty good hair oil!  Works like a polisher and sort of melts into the hair immediately without leaving behind any oiliness or residue.  My favorite part about this is how it softened my hair after a gel product hardened it.  It instantly helps to soften and revive dry, brittle hair.  The scent of this is almost nonexistent and reminds me of a faint cooking coconut oil.  I was a bit disappointed because I wanted something to connect the idea of jade to this oil.  The day after I used this, I took down my hair and was pleased.  It didn't feel crunchy, flaky, nor did it shed like I thought it would.  I could also finger detangle which added a star to my review!  Over time, I can tell that this helps to grow out hair while giving it a luster.  It's a bit on the pricier side, but the quality justifies it!

198,3.0 out of 5 stars Smells lightly clean and fresh but did not work for my hair,"My hair is baby fine and I live in a very humid part of the United States. Using oil on my hair is a part of my routine and when properly absorbed, I have loose curls. Because this smells so good, I really wanted it to work well. It did not. My hair felt soft but looked frizzy and the oil seemed to sit on my hair rather than absorb. The pump itself worked erratically, sometimes spitting out a tiny bit, the next time a palm full so it was hard to regulate the amount used.

200,5.0 out of 5 stars Better than shampoo,"I've been using another brand of cleanser like this one for years,, but didn't like the way it made my hair smell.  This one here smells awesome!! If this type of hair cleansing is new to you, remember,  a LITTLE product is all it takes. I have very fine hair. It works great on fine hair if you use only a small amount. Remember,  its not shampoo,  and it doesn't lather. Rinse it out of your hair well. It will leave your hair soft, and no additional conditioner is needed. It does take a little getting used to, if you've never used this type before, but I've been using it for years now, and I love it. Small amounts, and rinse very well. Occasionally I've used one of my salon shampoos, and my hair is rough, and tangled. This type here leaves your hair combable, and soft.  I've tried to get friends to give it a try, but they wont because it ""doesn't lather "", lol. And yes, it does cost some $$, BUT, this bottle is huge and you only use a very small amount so it will last forever. And btw, the pump does work. Took me awhile to figure it out, but all you do is pull up on it, and turn counterclockwise,  and voila, it pops right up ! Give it a try, its different but you will love it.

201,"5.0 out of 5 stars Bye bye frizz.... Hello shiny, glossy, soft and gorgeous hair","I received this in my glossybox.  My hair is long, thick, frizzy and coarse.  After the first use I noticed my hair less frizzy and glossy and beautiful  After three days my hair still looked clean and glossy. I used other products like this but they did not work at all.  I will reorder.  Yes it's pricy but you getting shampoo and conditioner in one.  I also am only using 2 quarter size amounts and like I saud have long thick hair.  Just try using less. It not suppose to lather so out it in your hair and massage in and wait couple minutes then wash out.  and you have gorgeous hair.  I let my sister use some and she too fell in love. I did not even know she used this and when I came home I said omg your hair is so shiny and clean looking and glossy.  She said yea I tried your unwash. She been using Wen products for couple years and unwash made her hair so much glossier than her Wen products. Update  I have long thick hair and I use Nickle size and massage on top then use Nickle worth product  and then massage up on the on the back of my head. I massage in for couple minutes then put it up in a clip and shave legs or shower then take clip out of hair massage again then rinse out. My hair stays cleaner and shiner longer. My hair so clean that every strand stands out. Now I noticed another benefit. It has been 5 weeks since I colored my hair and onky have couple grey hairs showing. When I was using high dollar shampoo for treated hair at 3 weeks my grey would pop back through.  So I can now go twice as long without dying my hair.  Still have half bottle left so it should last me 4 months so 27 dollars for both shampoo snd conditioner for 4 months is a value. Plus not coloring my hair as often but the biggest benefit is my head is not itching anymore , I noticing less hair falling out (54 yr old )  Every strand of my hair stands out, shiny , glossy and don't have to use a lot to get clean hair.  My hair less frizzy and HAIR LOOKS LIKE 20 yr old head of hair.

202,4.0 out of 5 stars works great but took off star b/c pump broken on last 2,"I loved biolage’s cleansing conditioner, but it was discontinued, so this is my 2nd favorite. The actual product is great (5 stars)—it has a light pleasant scent & doesn’t weigh down my very fine hair; I have fashion color hair (pastels in this pic) & sometimes only see little color rinse out, whereas w/olaplex or redken acidic bonding shampoo & conditioner sets, I see a significant amount of color rinse out every time. It keeps my hair soft, but my stylist always uses olaplex during my service—which makes a huge difference. Keep in mind, like most cleansing conditioners or co-washes, it doesn’t lather & make sure to thoroughly rinse it out. If your hair is very dirty then you should you wash it twice. I definitely recommend it, My issue is this is my 2nd purchase on Amazon & both times the pumps were broken, which is annoying, so I took off 1 star. In the future, I’ll probably buy it elsewhere to ensure the pump works. Also the unwash dry shampoo works well; however, beware the scent is very strong!

211,5.0 out of 5 stars My holy grail for thinning hair!,"I am literally so impressed with this product I cannot express how much I love it, but I'm gonna try! I have been working in the beauty industry for 4 years now and I have tried A LOT of products designed to do all sorts of things and often times they over promise and under deliver on results. But this is one hair product that did the exact opposite! Surface calls it a stimulating shampoo and conditioner and it's more like a mini miracle! I'm in my 20s, white male with curly hair that is very soft and fine textured, and it used to be so thick and lush when I was younger. In the last few years I've noticed more and more hair falling out constantly in the shower, when I style it, and even if I just run my hands through my hair they would come away coated in strands falling out. Needless to say I feel to young to be bald!!! So I went on the hunt for all kinds of solutions. I tried at least 10 different products all designed to help with thinning volume and hair loss. And none of them really did anything! Some of them tingled on my scalp, but that was about all the results I ever noticed. Well my sister recommended me this line which she has been having great results with since her post pregnancy hormones have caused her to lose a ton of hair as well! So I thought what could it hurt. Let me tell you am I glad I did! Not only is it a vegan and natural hair brand, but it WORKS!!! After 3 days 95% of my hair fallout had stopped!! I lose an occasional stand here or there now, but my hair feels great, is bunch and lively, and I have a heck of a lot more of it sticking around where is belongs on my head! It has a mild tingling sensation when you massage it on, which I think is a little stronger in the conditioner then the shampoo. And yes it does have cayenne pepper extract in it to stimulate circulation, so don't get it in your eyes cuz like most everything in life that gets in your eyes it will burn! DUH!! That person who said she didn't like it should give herself a 1 star rating for intelligence because she's the idiot who ordered the wrong thing! Don't blame the product for your not paying attention! I hate that! THIS IS DEFINITELY A 5 STAR PRODUCT!!!!! I will most definitely be buying it again! LOVE! It is a little bit more expensive then regular shampoo but these larger sizes aren't that bad when I spent 35 dollars each on 8oz bottles of other products that didn't work at all. If you want a great tingling, stimulating shampoo and conditioner that really does do a fantastic job give these a try! I'm glad I did!

212,5.0 out of 5 stars Works well for plaque psoriasis / dandruff,"Background: I've had plaque psoriasis for years. Years of extreme itchiness, large dandruff flakes and plaque buildup around the hairline, and waking up several times each night to violently scratch my head.  I primarily used the MG217 coal tar shampoo, which works well enough but smells horrible and leaves the hair feeling very dry. I recently switched to the Surface healthy scalp shampoo (only the shampoo, not the whole 3-step system Surface recommends). I was very skeptical, as the claims all read like woo-woo pseudoscience. HOWEVER, I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and have been very pleased with the results. It has been a gradual but noticeable improvement. My scalp is significantly less itchy than it has been in months, the plaque buildup is nearly gone, and I only notice flakes when using a fine-tooth comb with a decent amount of pressure on the scalp. I expect the improvement to continue, but time will tell. The shampoo also smells great (very ""fresh"" smelling; not perfumey at all) and doesn't leave the hair feeling dried-out like my previous shampoo. Very little shampoo is needed to get a good lather going, so don't be too put off by the price; you'll get a lot of use out of a single bottle. I will update this review somewhere down the line if I find that the shampoo stops working for my condition. For the time being, I recommend. Check the ingredients list to ensure you won't have an allergic reaction like some people seem to have had.

213,3.0 out of 5 stars High price for 10 oz of liquid-y (not concentrated) product,"I'm an Olaplex kind of a girl and their shampoo is concentrated and good value...this required quite a bit of product to lather up my chin-length, thinning hair.  After styling, hair still thin on the sides and--something I truly didn't like--blonde streaks of colored hair were somehow darker and 'muddied'. The salon used this product (and mousse) and it seemed OK.  Didn't like the price and the way it took away the 'pops' of blonde streaking when used at home.  Not for me.

215,5.0 out of 5 stars Super conditioner,"This stuff is amazing. I recently had a lot of highlights put in my hair and the level of dryness and tangles that ensued was just beyond anything I’ve ever experienced. I tried several color safe conditioners before this one and none of them helped to moisturize and detangle like this one did. It was almost instantaneous but I let it sit for even longer in the shower and the resulting softness and deranging was nothing short of a miracle. It smells lovely and adds a non-greasy non-heavy shine and snap to your hair that is just wonderful. After using this, I also went ahead and bought their leave-in conditioner and that one is just as amazing as well. I could get away with only using one or the other but I’ve always loved the way shower conditioner leaves your hair. Unite for the win!! Thank you for helping my hair!!!

217,5.0 out of 5 stars First detangler that works on my child's matted hair,"Wow. We have tried many detanglers and this was the FIRST ONE that really helped us brush through my daughter's hair. Her hair tangles from NOTHING. She literally can sit still in a chair and within an hour, the nape of her neck is tangled. But if she is out doing normal activities, forget it. She gets MATTED on a daily basis. Her hair is fine and it's very painful to brush out the knots. So we got this and she is able to brush her hair while this product is on her hair in the shower. We are so happy with the results. It's super expensive so it had to be AMAZING to be worth the price. Well, I think it is.

I’ve been using 7 Seconds for less than a week and my hair looks and feels healthier in the shower, out of the shower, two days after the shower.. I rarely use hot tools on my hair but when I did, my hair stayed bouncy and shiny. This is worth every penny and (as far as I can tell) is the real salon grade product.

225,,"I first came across this at my hairdressers, but they were charging almost double the price for purchasing via Amazon, so it was a 'no-brainer' for me to buy it online when I needed a replacement. It lasts for ages and really works - a few quick squirts onto long wet hair makes brushing through much easier. It doesn't make my hair greasy and can be used on its own or in addition to wash-out conditioner. Tips: I don't use it at the roots or on my fringe. Brush your hair straightaway after applying - leaving it to dry in causes tangles and is therefore counter-productive!

It seemed sticky and thick, and didn’t really seem to warm or soften and glide over my hair. Good hair oils are supposed to glide and flow over your hair without weighing it down too much; this sort of did the opposite.

235,5.0 out of 5 stars Bit Pricey But Worth It,"I used this on both mine and my daughter’s hair and I saw instant results.

I am a Sicilian/African American mix and my daughter is the same with Filipino genetics as well. She has extremely long (past her bottom), thick, and curly hair. I washed and air dried my hair but did use the recommended pumps of the Amazon Oil in my hair. The next day I flat ironed my hair using more oil (I sectioned my hair and used about three pumps per section). My hair came out very soft, silky, and billowy. My hair doesn’t feel weighed down nor does it feel greasy. I know it is a bit pricey and it may not work on everyone’s hair type but it worked for mine and my daughter's hair.

248,5.0 out of 5 stars Ahava Hand Cream smells heavenly and is VERY moisturizing!,"I have such dry cuticles and almost nothing works to fix that.  I use 100% shea butter on them and over that usually add another moisturizer to ""lock in"" the shea butter/moisture.  Had been using another competitor's hand cream and it was fine, but ran out and tried Ahava.  Well.  Are Dead Sea minerals the secret to excellent moisturizing?  Maybe!  For me this may be the absolute best hand cream I've ever used, and I am in my 60s!  It's quite thick but still easy to spread, and no need to use a lot.  It also smells heavenly.

259,"4.0 out of 5 stars Non-sticky, non-oily, absorbent - Scented - I like it","The description of the product sounds great and trustworthy. It was created by plastic surgeons from Burn Center Beverwijk to help restore and protect the skin barrier from external influences. It offers intensive care for hands that are frequently washed, sanitized, or irritated. My hands feel soft with minimal shine. Scent is subtle on my skin. It smells fresh/clean and a little floral. It has a lightweight, lotion consistency. The formula is absorbent, non-sticky, non-oily, and non-irritating. It offers a lot of positives. However, I do have complaints: (1) Neither the box nor underneath/around the lid was sealed. Absolutely no protection. Unfortunately, not uncommon for companies so I’ll use it anyway. (2) Why is it so expensive, $30? Because it’s imported from the Netherlands? (3) While I do like the scent, I don’t think fragrance should be added to products made for irritated hands. (4) It does not feel intensive or rich so I do question its ability to effectively heal the skin barrier. After saying all of that, I still think it is a nice hand (or body) moisturizer that I’ll happily use. I’ll be using this mainly as a preventative since my hands aren’t currently in need of repair. I should also add that I am prone to wrist rashes and this did not cause a flare up. -Ingredients: aqua, ethylhexyl stearate, cetearyl alcohol, cyclopentasiloxane, tocopheryl acetate, glycerin, dimethicone, cyclohexasiloxane, butyrospermum parkii butter, octyldodecanol, cetearyl glucoside, mel, ribes nigrum seed oil, bisabolol, allantoin, helianthus annuus seed oil, helianthus annuus seed oil unsaponifiables, sodium hyaluronate, cardiospermum halicacabum flower/leaf/vine extract, rosmarinus officinalis leaf extract, tocopherol, sodium polyacrylate, parfum, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin. *I used my phone to scan the ingredients from the tube.

260,5.0 out of 5 stars Soothing Hand Cream,"This hand cream has obviously been carefully created using the best ingredients for soothing the skin and providing good protection for the skin barrier. Plastic surgeons from a burn center would be the ones who would best know what the skin needs for repair and relief. It’s not the thickest hand cream I’ve ever used but that doesn’t mean it’s not better than the heavier ones. While the thicker ones may seem to provide a good barrier, the ingredients in this cream not only do that, but they are absorbed into the skin instead of just sitting on top, providing a way for the skin to heal and soothe at deeper layers. It’s a medium-weight cream that absorbs quickly and has a silky feel. It doesn’t leave any stickiness behind and my palms do not feel greasy which is a huge plus for a hand lotion!! The scent is pleasant and subtle and I only notice it if I put my nose close to my hand. Since it’s summer, it’s hard to know the true results although my hands feel very soft and moisturized at just the right amount. Winter will be the true test but based off of the proprietary ingredients listed, I am confident that this cream will keep my hands protected and smooth. While the price is more than I normally pay for a hand cream, I don’t need much of this and it will likely last me at least a few months. $10 a month for softer, younger-looking hands is worth it to me as a 49 year-old woman. There was no safety seal on either the box or bottle so I feel like that’s the one additional thing that could be done to make this a truly perfect product. Highly recommended!

263,4.0 out of 5 stars Works fine but is very expensive,"TLDR: Works OK but is very expensive I actually use this to help prevent painful cracking on my heels during the winter months.  That season is just starting and so far, this is doing fine in helping to keep my heels in decent shape.  But it really isn't working any better than petroleum jelly.  I do find it a little 'watery' and am not a fan of the squeeze tube it comes in as I'll need to take off the end cap to get the last few applications out of it. So it works but you'll need to decide if the price is worth it.

265,5.0 out of 5 stars Worth the Price!,"This hand cream was developed by plastic surgeons in a burn hospital in the Netherlands. Before using this Staudt hand cream, I was skeptical that it could be worth the high price. I found the cream to be a little more viscous (less thick) than I was used to in a hand cream. It went on easily and had a light, pleasant smell. It absorbed quickly without any stickiness or greasiness. I apply hand cream every night at bedtime. With this cream, my hands still feel silky and moisturized the following day, even though I've washed dishes a couple of times since using the cream. I've never had a hand cream work this long. I often need to apply lotion before doing needlework to ensure that threads don't catch on my hands and I have to be careful not to use any product that might stain my fabrics. I think that this lotion will be perfect!  I'm very impressed with the cream and believe that it is worth the high cost.

274,5.0 out of 5 stars They work!,"The ZenToes Moisturizing Fuzzy Sleep Socks have been a wonderful addition to my nightly self-care routine. Infused with Vitamin E, olive oil, and jojoba seed oil, these socks are designed to soften and hydrate dry, cracked heels, offering both comfort and skincare benefits. The regular size in blue fits perfectly and adds a soothing touch to my bedtime. One of the features I appreciate most is the intense moisturization these socks provide. The infusion of Vitamin E, olive oil, and jojoba seed oil delivers deep hydration to my feet, effectively softening and healing dry, cracked heels. After just a few nights of wearing these socks, I noticed a significant improvement in the texture and smoothness of my skin. My feet feel much softer and more comfortable, which is a relief after long days on my feet. The fuzzy, cozy design of the socks is another standout feature. They are incredibly soft and comfortable, providing a warm and snug fit that’s perfect for sleep. The plush material feels luxurious against the skin, making it a pleasure to wear them overnight. This added comfort enhances the overall experience, making it easier to stick to a nightly moisturizing routine. The design is practical and thoughtful. The socks fit snugly without being too tight, ensuring they stay in place throughout the night. The regular size is perfect for my feet, and they accommodate a range of foot sizes comfortably. The blue color adds a touch of style and fun, making the socks both functional and visually appealing. The socks are easy to care for, which is a significant advantage. They can be hand-washed or machine-washed on a gentle cycle, and they retain their softness and moisturizing properties even after multiple washes. This durability ensures that the socks continue to provide effective hydration and comfort over time, making them a worthwhile investment for foot care. The moisturizing effect lasts long after I take the socks off in the morning. My feet remain hydrated and smooth throughout the day, reducing the need for additional foot creams or lotions. This lasting effect is a testament to the quality and effectiveness of the ingredients used in the socks. Overall, the ZenToes Moisturizing Fuzzy Sleep Socks have exceeded my expectations. Their combination of deep moisturization, cozy design, practical fit, and easy care makes them an essential addition to any skincare routine. The socks have significantly improved the condition of my feet, providing effective relief for dry, cracked heels and ensuring lasting softness and hydration. I highly recommend these moisturizing socks to anyone looking for a comfortable and effective solution for foot care.

275,5.0 out of 5 stars Worked super well for me!,"I cannot emphasize enough how well these socks work. They’re comfortable, they do what they advertise, they really work!! I noticed some lower reviews because they have to be hand washed, I only wear them to bed after showering, to ensure I have clean and moist feet prior to putting them on. Handwashing does not bother me at all, they’re easy to wash. I shaved the calluses, and used an aquaphor moisture mask (with it!!), then I  consistently put these socks on, after applying heel balm (flexitol).  I’ve only used them a handful of times overnight and my cracked heels are healing. I’m so happy with the results. My feet are softest they’ve ever been. Worth every cent!!

278,5.0 out of 5 stars One of THE BEST purchases I’ve EVER made,"For the past 15 years, my heels have become allergic to many things, including cats & chickens. That might sound weird, but we used to have a ranch, and if I went outside barefoot even for just a few steps, I’d regret it for a week at the very least. My heels crack & bleed, and the entire process goes from discomfort to downright painful. I wear slides or crocs everywhere in & around the house, except to bed. Even with being extremely cautious, when the weather changes and we have to run the furnace my heels crack & bleed. I’ve tried EVERYTHING. Literally every foot cream on the market, slathered my feet in Vaseline & wrapped them before bed, tried a salon treatment. You name it, my feet have had it. And while some things work, eventually, nothing works every time. Until I got these socks. I really didn’t expect much, but as I said, I’ll try anything just to get some relief. I was surprised when the socks arrived, because I didn’t realize there were 2 pair in the pack. I ordered the “mens black” size. I wear a womans 8 & 1/2, but I wanted to make sure they were big enough because I don’t like anything squeezing my feet. These absolutely run small. The “mens” were tight on me, so I stretch them over a canister when I’m not wearing them or after washing. Anyway, back to results. I used these the first night after receiving them. As I said, they were a little tight, so that was uncomfortable, but I could absolutely feel relief on my heels the next morning. I wore these socks every night for a week, even though my heels were healed in about 4 days! Now the skin on my heels is still somewhat cracked, but there’s zero pain and no bleeding at all. I’ve gotten so used to my feet not bothering me that I sometimes forget to put the socks on at night. I was wearing them every night, but now I wear them just a couple times a week. They wash up easily in the sink with gentle laundry detergent and have worked wonderfully for over 3 months now. I can’t tell you how wonderful it is to not have to limp around on sore heels, or have Vaseline marks all over the foot of our bed. These socks are magnificent!

279,"3.0 out of 5 stars Cute, soft, but fall apart","These half socks are great if you want to moisturize your heels, but have feet that get hot at night. However, they are made poorly, and if you wash them (because ew), they unravel immediately. I’ve had to cut so many strings off and throw away one pair. Also, the gel that’s built into these doesn’t do squat—and I didn’t think it would. How could it?

284,,"I recently purchased the Zen Toes Socks, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results! These socks are a game-changer for anyone looking to pamper their feet and keep them soft and moisturized. The socks are incredibly comfortable to wear, made from high-quality materials that feel soft against the skin. The built-in moisturizing gel pad on the heels is a genius addition – it delivers a burst of hydration to dry, cracked heels (mine are horrible) leaving them feeling smooth and rejuvenated. I love using these socks as part of my self-care routine. Simply slip them on before bed or while relaxing at home, and let the moisturizing gel work its magic. After just a few uses, I noticed a significant improvement in the condition of my heels – they felt softer and looked visibly healthier. Not only are these socks effective, but they are also durable and easy to clean.

285,5.0 out of 5 stars Works great for the toughest of calluses,My calluses crack and cause my feet to bleed. This instrument is what keeps me walking without limping. I cannot say enough about how I like it. It's fairly inexpensive and it keeps its charge for quite a while. One thing I would add is that I would suggest getting some cream for your feet. I recommend pairing this product with Gold Bond diabetes foot cream. The two make an awesome pair! Read more,01 Nov 2024,J.

295,"4.0 out of 5 stars Works fine, scent isn't overpowering.","The packaging for this cuticle oil is pretty and cute. It has a nice weight to it and doesn't feel flimsy. The brush applicator is easy to use. The cuticle oil has a very very light peach smell that isn't overpowering and is barely noticeable compared to other cuticle oils that are scented. The cuticle oil absorbs into the skin easily without leaving an overly greasy residue. It also doesn't have any added colorants, which I think is an added bonus. The labeling on the packaging is easy to read and also includes an ingredient list. It's easy to open and close the bottle, but it also feels secure enough to safely carry in a bag or purse without the fear of leaking. I would recommend this cuticle oil to those that are looking for a cuticle oil with just a hint of scent that doesn't linger.

306,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible results,"This product is sooo good. It worked for me where other natural creams and balms didn't. It got rid of a patch of dermatitis that developed on my inside elbow bend area. Nothing was dealing with what was a very painful, itchy and sore condition. I had never had a skin condition before, so it took me a minute to search and test out different things. Thank goodness I found this perfect solution!!!! I believe it is the Manuka Honey within it that makes a huge impact on healing and also fading any scaring after healing has occurred. If it helps to know, I store the Balm of Gilead in our fridge, because I like it to be a bit firmer when using it daily and it also gives a nice cool temperature to the balm - which feels good when applying it. Plus I feel balms and creams stay fresher stored within  fridge. I ensure the lid is on nice and tight however. I would highly recommend this GEM!!!! The scent is very clean and adorable too!!!!

308,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty Good,"So I like this cream, but I don't like the smell. It's a weird waxy smell, but that's understandable due to what it's made of. The cream is very thick and it doesn't take much to cover your skin as it spreads well, especially if you rub it between your hands and warm it before applying. I've used the cream on my face, legs and different problem areas on my body like scarring or skin irritations. I started wearing a smartwatch 24/7 recently and it started to rub my skin wrong underneath from wearing it to bed every night. I used this cream to heal the marks that it started to form on my wrist and applied it every day after I showered before putting on my watch and it made a big difference. My only issue with the cream other than the smell is that it does have a tendency to make me break out on my face off and on. I've been trying to figure out what makes it break me out whether that be applying too much at a time, tried not using it every day etc, but I haven't found a perfect routine just yet. Overall I would rate the cream 7/10 for its moisture and healing properties. I've found myself using it less often than I planned to due to the consistency, smell and it causing breakouts. However, considering the ingredients and the properties it has I can see it being used once or twice a week on your face and still be effective. I have also used it on my legs after shaving and it helps a ton with bumps.

309,5.0 out of 5 stars Loving this product after giving it another chance,"Having had a recent eczema flare up and wanting to avoid prolonged use of cortizone creams, I sought for alternatives.  Had high hopes for this product, alas, it did absolutely nothing to alleviate my eczema.  After using this product exclusively for a week straight, I can say the dry cracking skin got progressively worse and the itchiness intensified.  Had to go back to my tried and true regimen of colloidal and cortizone creams which provided great relief just after one day. Update: Had a recent bad flare-up and colloidal creams weren't helping much.  Tried a popular petroleum based ointment which turned out that I am allergic to.  I gave the Manuka honey cream a second chance.  It still doesn't do much to alleviate itchiness, but it does work to reduce swelling and slowly healing a painful fissure caused by my allergic reaction to the petro ointment I was using.  For areas that are just dry and itchy, and not swollen or cracked, I use Cetaphil Restoraderm which works better than other colloidal creams I had been using because of its thicker consistency and perhaps ingredients that just work better to relief itchiness keeping the skin hydrated.  I do not use the Cetaphil on cracked skin though because it can sting pretty badly. Lastly, I really love the fresh citrusy, herb smell of this honey cream.  The consistency is also perfect.  It isn't runny, nor is it thick and greasy like a petro based ointment.  Raising this product to a well-deserved 5 stars!

311,"3.0 out of 5 stars Dunno, pros & cons","I try to chill it in the fridge before use so it goes on a bit like egyptian magic,  but it comes on very oily and does not absorb into the skin. Been trying to use it to improve my eczema. Something in it is very aggravating to me. Within 5 minutes of application I feel an intense itch. But,  if I wrap the area and cover the wraps with cloth the result is negligibly better.  Not anything super impressive though. Not sure if it's worth the intense itchiness which has had me on and off if I should return it. It has a somewhat strong smell to it which may give ppl with a sensitive nose light headedness, but it's not a bad smell, I'd guess it's from the tea tree oil. I will try a bit longer.

314,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing product,"I’ve done 3 foot peel masks this year and while they worked on the majority of my foot it didn’t do much for the calluses on my heels and balls of my feet. I got this to see if it could help just those particular areas. I soaked my feet in hot water with Epsom salts, and baking soda for about 30 or so mins. Then I opened the bottle and applied the gel to those areas on one foot. I let it sit for 5 mins. The bottle said aim for 3-7 mins. Then I washed it off and used the rasp that came with the bundle. It worked amazing.  I got so much skin off and it didn’t hurt at all. After I finished one foot I did the other. My feet now look and feel super soft. I plan to do another foot peel this weekend to see if now that most of the rough skin is gone if that will help get the rest of it. If not then in a couple weeks I will repeat this process with the gel and see what happens. Over all I am very happy with this product. Gel is clear in color. I wish that the bottle came with a twist spout top as the open top isn’t ideal for applying directly to a small area. I had to put it in my glove and then apply it. Photos are of one of my feet with the gel on it. And then after being scrubbed and washed off.

318,4.0 out of 5 stars Works very well; rasp arrived broken,"I get calluses built up on my big toes and heels. I normally use a synthetic pumice stone after a shower to keep my calluses smoothed down, but I've found that using this gel is much more efficient. It feels like the calluses have practically melted away and I just use my pumice stone to scrape away the residue which doesn't take long at all (but fair warning, it looks pretty gross). Using the gel has resulted in a more even removal of the calluses as well, which leaves me with smoother feet overall. Use common sense with this product as it is caustic. Only apply the gel onto your callused areas, and only leave it on for the recommended time. I also put some plastic wrap over my feet to keep the gel moist the entire time it was sitting on my calluses. Also, make sure to thoroughly wash your feet with soap afterwards, as the gel residue feels very slippery and you don't want to leave that on your skin for an extended period of time. You shouldn't experience any kind of burns or stinging if you follow these directions. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the foot rasp arrived shattered and unusable. Truth told, I was always going to start with my pumice stone anyway and only try the rasp if I needed to. Thankfully the pumice stone I already had does an amazing job without needing to use the rasp. Despite this issue, I still definitely recommend the product.

320,5.0 out of 5 stars Wow - better than any pedicure I remember,"I have had hard, rough skin on my heels and on the underside of my feet forever. I usually get pedicures *not* to have cute toenails but to have a chance at smooth, soft feet for a few days. I've tried a few things including the foot masks that result in peeling feet for weeks. I promise you nothing has had the results that this gel and this process had! I followed the directions and even had soapy water ready in case the gel unexpectedly hurt my feet so I could wash them quickly. No need. I let the gel work its magic for nearly 5 minutes, then I easily [and with no force required!] scraped away dead skin with the provided rasp....and there was a lot of dead skin!  To ensure I really cleaned up, I additionally and gently used my own pumice stone across the tops of my toes. It's Day 4 and I've been running, working out, walking barefoot, and living life with no pain and all while enjoying super-soft feet...better than any pedicure and certainly longer lasting. I am using lotion each night to amplify how good this feels.  I love this new find and plan to send some to my sister!! *Note: before you start, consider where you will let your legs rest with feet off the ground during the 4-7 minutes so the gel can absorb on your feet...I sat on the edge of the tub with my legs over top of the toilet lid because I didn't preplan that part.

325,4.0 out of 5 stars Works great for its intended purpose - be sure to moisturize.,"In recent years I've noticed that the hair on my legs grows way faster, and has gotten way coarser. While much of this is due to age, I had this AH HA moment - I used veet all through high school and early 20's. Now that I've been using it again I truly believe that regular use results in thinner hair, because it effects the follicles. That said I'll start with pros: 1.) Really effective. I'm not a super hairy person, but the hairs are definitely there. In my initial testing I stuck with 2 minutes before I started scraping, and most of the hairs swiped right off. Now I do about 4 minutes for good measure (be sure to do a test patch, and follow the instructions to be safe). 2.) As mentioned earlier - I'm noticing that the hairs are growing in slower, and less coarse. 3.) The price is great compared to anything you'd do in a salon (along with the level of pain - with Veet it's zero). 4.) I have pretty sensitive skin and this doesn't lead to much irritation (see Con #1 for clarification) Now the cons: 1.) Another thing I forgot about  - regular use of this product turns your skin into the Sahara. Immediate alligator skin. Make sure to moisturize very frequently. 2.) The smell is so terrible. And it lingers. I'm still trying to come up with a solution to not smell like an egg that has been rotting in a broken garbage disposal after using Veet. Soaking and scrubbing at various levels seems to be the best bet, but even with my best efforts, I still get whiffs the day of use. The cons, while unpleasant, do not outweigh the pros - I'm very happy to have found my way back to Veet.

333,4.0 out of 5 stars Worked okay for me,"I got this to try hair removal in let's say delicate spots, wanting an alternative to trimmers and razors.  I figured a woman's product might be advanced, yet gentle enough to do the trick.  One of the first things I noticed in the instructions was under the warnings, saying do not use in certain areas that the product description on the Amazon listing page specifically says it is okay for (around genital area).  Different parts for me, but still a confusing bit of direction, so just be aware of that. The conflicting information was enough to deter me from using it in those bathing suit areas, but I did try it out on my chest/torso, with decent results.  They probably would be better with more practice on my side, as I've never used a depilatory cream before.  I tried a test spot as suggested, and the full 8 minute time range.  It worked pretty well, getting most of the hair and definitely impacting the ones left behind.  It was a little awkward for me using the spatula, but I got fairly good coverage and results. For the next application over a broader area I used my hands to smooth it around, trying hard not to rub it into the skin as warned against in the directions.  However, it is hard not to rub in a cream into your skin a little when using hands, and the layer of the cream was much thinner.  I got similar results to the test run, where a lot of hair was removed, but some stubble remained.  It was definitely brittle and damaged by the product, even if it was still there. I think practice with the spatula is key to keeping a thicker layer without rubbing into the skin.  I think this would give the best results.  I will keep at it, as I had no adverse reaction on either attempt, meaning no pain, burning, redness, etc. Read more",21 Jun 2024,QPM,4.0,B0C59YG76X,"https://www.amazon.com/womn-Intimate-Comfort-REMOVAL-underarms/dp/B0C59YG76X/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

334,3.0 out of 5 stars Fairly Works,"Okay so i tried this product on my legs and armpits. It says to leave on 4mins and try a bit and not to exceed 8 mins. I had to leave it for more than 8 mins and it works, deff not a 4min thing. My legs feel smooth and it did not irritate my skin so good on that ! On my armpits not so much, i applied it and left it on but once removed there was lots of hair left behind so i would have to do a second time and see results wouldn’t recommend same day just fyi. the amount is maybe for a one time use if you are doing all body parts in one day. So would recommend to buy a few of these if you want it to last longer than one time all body parts.

336,2.0 out of 5 stars You'll still need to shave afterwards,"The wax is easy enough to use. You simply apply the cream, glide it onto your skin and wait 4 minutes before rinsing off.

I gave it a second chance, this time leaving it on the other armpit for 7 minutes. Again, nothing. This may work on very, very fine hair but it's a complete bust otherwise. It should be only one star but I'm giving it two because I like the plastic applicator it came with.

344,"5.0 out of 5 stars It’s great, which makes me sad.","I grew up not confident in my skin because of how often I would get ingrown hair that left me with itchy and scarred skin. I was hesitant to try this because of the cost, but I gave in and it works! No itching, hairs are growing out normally, and scars are minimized. It’s a highly effective product, but personally, it’s too pricey at $1/pad. I tried cutting the pad in half as some have suggested, but that small bit won’t cover all the areas I need it for.

348,5.0 out of 5 stars Disgusting But Effective (Gross Details Below),"I had what I thought was an ingrown hair in a very sensitive area, and I was about to go to the doctor for it. It was huge, it was painful, and every attempt I'd made with hot compresses, aftershave stuff, a gentle exfoliating toner, and baths had failed. It had only gotten bigger (I am not kidding when I say this was like two cranberry size bumps under the skin). As a last ditch effort, I bought these. I used them yesterday, right out of the shower, and I will tell you that it burned like absolute fire. Like, I nearly washed myself with cool water. I'd been messing with this thing quite a bit though, so it makes sense that my skin was not in the best shape to begin with. It really stung quite a bit for about 10 minutes, on top of the existing pain in that area. While I was showering the next day (so roughly 24 hours), I was washing it, and I could tell that it felt different. It was smaller, less hard, and there was something weird on the top. I couldn't figure out what it was, and I had to take a closer look after the shower once I had my glasses. What I initially thought was a gigantic head that I was certain would pop with very little provocation turned out to be what I think was a keratin plug? It was a little yellow stone thing that came out (not an ingrown hair). One night, and something that has been painful and disruptive for almost a week was taken care of. Although it's not fully back to normal, the difference between yesterday and today is insane, both in the way I feel and how it looks.  I don't think I will ever not have these in my house again purely because if this is how it worked on a bad clogged pore, what kind of effect will it have on the kind of everyday ingrown hairs everyone gets?

It doesn’t magically erase wrinkles overnight, but with consistent use there’s definitely a clear difference. I also like that it layers well with other products in my skincare routine.

Definitely will buy again! I wanted to come back several months later to add more to my review. The product is a good value for the money as it lasts quite a long time. I still have my original purchase. As I said before, I add it like a highlighter to add a bit of shine at the top of my cheekbones and collarbone. It is glossy and wet looking at first, but once the skin absorbs it in there is an effect of a glow from within. I've found when younger (gen x) we were pushed to make our oily teen skin look matte to appear more mature, but now that we are this recreates that youthful luminosity to the skin precisely where it is applied. I've also put this under my eyes and noticed a reduction in puffiness, but definitely apply it a bit before you need it to give it time to absorb.  I get compliments on my skin almost every time I wear it.

361,3.0 out of 5 stars It’s nice but not amazing,"I bought this on an Amazon deal day. It’s supposed to be all the rage in Korea.  There aren’t instructions for the best way to use it.  I looked something up online.  It says to apply after your normal skincare routine.  It feels nice going on.  Does it improve the wrinkles or skin tone?  Not so much.  The most I think it does it give you a little shine, but my skin isn’t super dry.  I bought one for under my eyes, too, because my skin there is crepey.  I think it helps a bit more there.  Makes applying my concealer easier! I’m using each stick daily, but I probably won’t buy them again. Read more",09 Nov 2024,S. G.

362,5.0 out of 5 stars It's Addictive,"I'm really enjoying this wrinkle bounce multi stick. Makes my skin so soft but not so sure about my wrinkles. I don't fund it sticky at all as a matter of fact it's really slick! Seems like quality stuff and has a light fragrance.  I'm unsure about all the salmon stuff in it as I haven't done any research on it but I do really enjoy putting it on my face, it's like habit forming. I wish it came with more in it like maybe the size of the old Bonnie Bell Lip slackers did. This is smaller than that. I'm wondering now about the other salves in the line. I might try the purple one for eyes next. Oh, and not sure about putting it on your lips. I read you can and then I read not to.

363,5.0 out of 5 stars Works great,"I bought this Kahi multi balm with the recommendation of my good co worker. She has been using it for a while and has a nice glowing and glass skin. So I did try it and surely did not dissappoint. I used to have melasma, dry and dull skin. After few weeks of consistently using it, the melasma fades away. My skin feels smoother and healthier. It is also a very good lip moisturizer. Just don't over apply as it can be a bit greasy. Overall its a must have.

373,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Product,"After losing my regular eye cream while on vacation, I purchased Elemis Pro-Collagen Eye Renewal.  It is somewhat pricey but worth every penny.

395,"5.0 out of 5 stars Expensive, but so worth the price!","First I have to admit this was an impulse buy. I don’t usually purchase any skin care products without being able to feel them or smell them, or optimally, receive a free sample. But...I was at home recovering from a foot surgery, feeling totally housebound, and had way too much time on my hands to scroll around and explore on Amazon. I had previously purchased the Elemis foot care cream, which is amazing, by the way. So I decided to see what else this brand had to offer. This cream had wonderful reviews, and being now on the dark-side of 50, I knew I really should be wearing something with sunscreen. (Quite a few of the reviewers had received a free sample during a cruise; LOL, I’ve never been on a cruise!) So I received this and fully expected not to like something about it. Well, it has a lovely fresh scent that reminds me of the blue-green color of the jar. It is light, but substantial enough that it feels like it definitely is providing moisture. It is not oily or greasy. Once it is absorbed it leaves a nice silkiness on your skin that allows makeup to be applied flawlessly. This is the most expensive product that I have ever purchased, but I have to say that I think it is well worth the price.

401,5.0 out of 5 stars My daily cleanser ⭐️,"I’ve been using Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser for a while now, and it’s become a staple in my skincare routine. One of the best things about this cleanser is how truly gentle it is. My skin is quite sensitive, and I’ve struggled in the past to find a cleanser that cleans effectively without causing irritation. Vanicream is completely free of harsh ingredients like fragrance, dyes, and sulfates, which makes it perfect for anyone with sensitive or allergy-prone skin. Despite being gentle, it still does a fantastic job at removing dirt and oil, leaving my face feeling clean but never stripped or tight. The texture is lightweight, and it lathers up just enough to feel like it’s doing the job without being overly foamy. It rinses off easily, which I really appreciate. If you’re looking for a basic, reliable cleanser that you can trust to be non-irritating, Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser is an excellent choice. It’s affordable, dermatologist-recommended, and delivers exactly what it promises: a clean, calm face without any unnecessary additives.

The Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser has earned the Seal of Acceptance from the National Eczema Association and is dermatologist-tested, so I feel confident using it on my skin. It's also non-comedogenic, which means it won't clog pores. While the ingredients may cause a slight variation in aroma between batches, I appreciate that Vanicream prioritizes skin sensitivity over fragrance. Overall, I highly recommend this cleanser for anyone with sensitive skin or looking for a gentle yet effective product for daily use.

The only reason I have removed one star is that consistent use (twice daily) makes my face feel ever so slightly dry. It's not enough for me to consider it a major issue and I will continue to use it, I would have just expected not to encounter this with a product so specifically designed for sensitive skin.

407,5.0 out of 5 stars Very gentle,"I needed a gentle cleanser that would clean my face and at the same time doesn't aggravate my already barrier-compromised skin. This cleanser is perfect. Doesn't have any unnecessary ingredients. A little goes a long way. It's not very foaming, but that's part of the reason why I got it because cleansers that foam too much can irritate your skin. I have used it up to 4 times a day and it still didn't dry my skin out. Love the product and would definitely buy again.

Though a bit on higher price range it offers such pure effects on skin leaving it supple and clean. Your skin can’t go wrong with this amazing product.

414,5.0 out of 5 stars Everything from the Blue Lagoon is magic.,"I went to the Blue Lagoon while in Iceland several years ago. While you are swimming, they offer you their signature silica mask. It is magical. I have never had my skin feel so smooth or nourished before or since. Unfortunately, it is also very expensive, as I discovered when I looked it up online when I got back home. Needless to say, I was super excited to try this. This is not the same mask I used, but it does have the silica as a major ingredient, and it seems to have the same effect of making my face feel ridiculously soft. I don't know why it works so well but it's fantastic! My only qualm is that the smell of this mask is a bit odd, which I assume is the algae? It's sort of nutty but marine-like at the same time. However, it's still a five star mask for me because of how it makes my face feel. I still think the brand is expensive, but having tried this one, I'd consider buying the silica one too, since I prefer the smell.

415,5.0 out of 5 stars works amazing!!,This Blue lagoon nourishing algae face mask is amazing!! I’ve used so many face masked before and so far I like this one the most!! The consistency was very creamy yet rich. It spreads easily and thinly. The scent isn’t too good but at least it works really well. My skin always feel so smooth and hydrated. My skin is always so dry during the winter and this helps prevent it from breaking out. Overall I really like this product and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in this product!!

416,4.0 out of 5 stars Little Goes a Long Way,"I was a bit thrown off by the cost of this mask, but I was excited to try it due to the unique ingredients. I am glad to report that you only need a small amount each time so this small tube should last a very long time. I apply it to my face after I cleanse, and leave it on for 10 min. Any longer, and it can dry me out (I have combination oily skin). After I wash it off, I noticed that my skin looked blurred and smooth. It also really softened my skin. Unfortunately, those results don’t last very long. But I have noticed that as I use it regularly (2-3 times a week), the results last longer. I love to use it before I wear make up, which is not too often these days. When I do use it before primer and foundation, the application is a lot smoother. It’s like I’m wearing a primer already, which makes the actual foundation primer. I put on top work a lot better. It also helps reduce the look of fine lines, but that affect is very temporary and I have not seen a noticeable diminishing effect on lines how long are use it. However, I do love the way it makes my skin look and feel. It’s like having a social media filter on!

Below are a few general observations about my experience with with this product. --Scent- This mask has a sour, earthy smell to it. It is very true to the ""algae"" name. --Texture- I mean this in the best possible way, but the texture of this mask is like smooth guacamole. It feels like a very creamy clay mask. --Ease of Use- This mask is easy to apply. It goes on smooth and rinses clean. There is no mess. It did not stain my light-colored towels. --Results- This mask has a soothing quality while it's on. After removing, it leaves skin feeling hydrated. Unfortunately, I didn't experience any visible change. --Packaging- This product was minimally packaged. I appreciate that there wasn't much waste!

448,"5.0 out of 5 stars Inexpensive, Nifty","As my skin ages, I am finding that the skin under my eyes is turning into a real problem area.  My under eyes show when I don't sleep enough; the delicate skin reddens and puffs up, and the skin is also dry and thin.  That's such a recipe for needing great skin care! The NATUREKIND Hyaluron Lifting Eye Cream treats several of these problem areas.  It has a roller-type application, and it feels soothing while applying the cream to the skin.  I don't use a lot under each eye.  Also, for me personally, it's VERY effective.  I realize that the roller may have something to do with it, but it does reduce some of my puffiness within a few minutes.  My under eye swelling/puffiness started to decrease about five minutes after I applied this eye cream.  Again, probably the soothing nature of the metal roller helped that, too.  It feels like a tiny massage. My under eye area was very smooth after I applied this.  It melted into my skin without a shiny or greasy look.  Instead, the area looked refreshed and glowy.  What stood out for me was the ease with which I could pat my concealer over the cream.  I did not notice any pilling, and my skin didn't pull.  The cream was hydrating, and didn't sit in any fine lines.  It also left my skin dewy, which was a great palette for any other makeup I needed for the area. My favorite thing about this cream is the price point!  It isn't too expensive.  Highly recommended.

449,4.0 out of 5 stars Great applicator for this eye cream,"This eye cream is great for dark spots and fine lines. It contains hyaluronic acid, 5% arbutin, and niacinamide. It's a Korean skin care product that I really like. Instructions are in a different language but this pen is easy to use. I like how the back you can twist so it locks and no product will come out.

450,5.0 out of 5 stars Super convenient application system,"The eye serum itself is a nice product. It absorbs well and is non-greasy. By itself, this is already a very good product. The part I like about this is the eye roller and how it is so easy to apply. It's a push button to push out the correct amount of serum to the roller part to apply. The push button can also be closed off so that you don't accidentally push the product out. This is great in case you are taking it with you in a bag when traveling. The roller part is convenient and easy to control when applying. It makes it easier to apply to the sensitive area around the eyes that you don't want to apply too much pressure on.

451,4.0 out of 5 stars Easy to use eye cream,"The Naturekind hyaluron lifting eye cream has now been added into my night skin care routine. I like how easy it is to use with a simple pump and roll. The only thing I wished the pen had was a little window or something that would show you how much of the cream is left because I can see myself getting to the end of the bottle and just wondering if it dried out or if there's some of the cream still at the top. The cream feels refreshing as you're rolling it around your eyes which is nice. I like that the pump at the back of the pen allows you to lock the device so that you're not accidentally pumping the cream into the cap. The instructions on how to use the pen are on the box, but the instructions or ingredients on the pen itself are in Korean.

452,"3.0 out of 5 stars feel refreshing, comes out nicely, no change","I have been using this cream for a month now. It feels refreshing upon application, it is easy and mess-free to apply, and it is gentle on my skin. Even if it is not advertised as scent-free it either is or is very nearly fragrance free. While I do my best to never get this close enough to my eye to get it in my eye, Ia am prone to rubbing my eyes and have surely rubbed some of this into my eyes at some point to no ill effect. While I like how refreshing this feels, and appreciate how gentle it is, after a month of use, my dark circles are just as prominent as always, and my under-eye area which is unfortunately prone to dry skin is no more moisturized in the long-term. This is a nice way to wake up, but it doesn't seem to cause any visual improvements in skin texture or firmness of my under-eyes.

453,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing,I love this eye cream. It has a roller ball that the cream dispenses around so that you can roll the cream onto your skin. It has a very nice feel to it as you massage the cream into your skin using the roller ball tip. There is a button on the bottom of the bottle that dispenses the cream around the roller ball. It's the perfect amount for both eyes. The cream absorbs into the skin nicely and leaves a nice lifted result. I've used many eye creams that dispense around a roller ball applier. This one by far is my favorite. The roller ball is just so much more comfortable than the others I've tried.

454,5.0 out of 5 stars Very hydrating and great for my face but the arbutin was too strong for around my eyes,"This is a very hydrating cream that is also moisturizing. I love that it feels cool going on the skin, thanks to the roller ball. I had a slight stinging feeling in the skin under my eyes, but this is not unusual for me. I can only use a handful of products around my eyes and I think that the 5% arbutin was a bit strong for my skin there. However, it felt great on the rest of my skin so I will use it all over my face and apply extra to areas of my skin that are darker. There is a slight tackiness immediately after application, but then it sinks in and just leaves skin dewy. I think this is a great value for a high-quality Korean product. I included a photo of the ingredient list so that prospective buyers can evaluate the ingredients themselves.

462,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great Moisture, Tighter Under Chin, AND BETTER POSTURE/LESS TMJ - Unexpected! Love it!","What I actually liked most about the v-line chin shaping masks was something that surprised me - It made me more aware of my posture and of how I sit with the way I hold my neck and align my chin with my clavicle.  I know it has actually more instant benefits than postural awareness, like moisturization, collagen and elastin replenishment, and a more smooth and defined jawline, but I honestly thought it was the most helpful thing to be made aware of how greatly just the way I align my neck and jaw makes not only the appearance and contours of the chin better, more nourished and slender, but it actually makes you FEEL BETTER and less pain, shoulder and neck and jaw pain and stress and muscle tension, from just having the heightened awareness that using the v-line masks provides to you, in a purely structural and physiological way. There is a whole science of how having good posture kind of is its own impetus for creating future posture that is more correctly anatomical aligned, and thus HEALTHY - and I think that these masks really do that in a way that I wasn’t at all expecting. It’s kind of relaxing to go to bed after wearing one for 20-30 minutes, because it’s as if it removes a large percentage of my jaw/neck/even shoulder pain, and for someone with TMJ and chronic migraines, I really appreciate that aspect of the masks. Of course, I love the natural dermatological nourishment, as well as the cosmetic enhancement of having a tighter and firmer, structured chin and jawline, as everyone would, but the postural awareness side effects of wearing the masks are really a massive unexpected bonus that I believe anyone could really get help from that kind of experience. It’s like the mask works double time. I love it!!!

464,,"Pricey for sure but if it works, easier and cheaper than cosmetic chin lift. I got the idea from a friend who recently had a surgical chin lift. She was required to wear something very similar to this post op. So I went on Amazon and found this. Been using it for about 2 weeks. First week, every night for 1 hour. Then every 3 days for 1 hour. Be sure to stretch it a bit before wearing it so it’s comfortable on the ears (as instructions advise)  I gave this a 4 star because I’m still waiting to see how it is after one month. Will follow up again then. Preliminary thoughts are that something is happening! SECOND REVIEW:  does work and comfy after stretching. I wore it for about an hour.

469,5.0 out of 5 stars Finally living the dream of steaming my face,"I thought I had already reviewed this item, but perhaps the review was bounced for venturing into ""medical advice"", so I will not drill down into why anyone might want to steam one's face in this review. Hopefully it is OK to write that I, personally, do want to steam my face (and have for decades), but prior to obtaining this PMD SilkSteam Pro, I never did so - not even once. The thing is, that it seems easy enough to steam one's face w/o a special gadget. You literally just boil water, throw in some herbs, and hold your face over the boiling water (towel above to hold in the steam) for a bit, breathing in the steam and letting it hit your skin. Easy enough, but it also never happened for me. The kitchen is a busy place, I would end up explaining what I was doing or just yelling for people to go away instead of having a relaxing steaming session, and then, when kids were added to the mix, the prospect of having a pot of boiling water going on the stove for ""me time"" purposes went completely off the table (boiling water ending up on child is very bad). So, finally, this PMD SilkSteam Pro allowed me to achieve my facial steaming goals. It is save and easy to use. I can use it alone, away from the kitchen. Yay!

471,5.0 out of 5 stars So easy to use and feels very nice!,"There's literally nothing that I don't love about this facial steamer! First of all, it's incredibly easy to set up and use right out of the box. All you have to do is press the removable container on the front, and it comes out easily. Add water to the container (directions say distilled only to ensure the product's longevity), then pop it back in. A simple power button on the front is all you need to start a luxurious little steaming session. You can also add essential oils to a section in the top if desired (there are filters included). The steamer heats up very quickly and produces a wonderfully gentle steam. They call it ""SilkSteam technology"", which honestly is the perfect name for it, because the steam does have this light, silky feel to it. PMD has been a trusted brand in skincare for a while, and I can see why after using this facial steamer! I've only used it occasionally so far, but it feels so nice that I think I'll be adding it into my routine a few nights a week. As a side note, steam is such a nice comfort when I have itchy/watery eyes or congestion from seasonal allergies, so it's nice to have an easy way to do a facial steam. :) Read more",08 Sep 2024,Tiff,5.0,B0D6HS5H1P,"https://www.amazon.com/PMD-SilkSteam-Pro-Technology-Directional/dp/B0D6HS5H1P/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

484,3.0 out of 5 stars I want to like these but-,"These are very soft and seemed to be good quality to be use. I like that they come 4 to a case and come with a stand to dry one. As you see in my photo, the blender that I just washed split open a little bit. I was very gentle with it, I do not have fingernails that could snag it, it split for seemingly no reason soon after barely using it. I tested it out with some facial serum- I liked the smooth application and felt like it was better for my skin and wasted much less product than using cotton or my fingers. And then I gently dipped it into a very mild, diluted cleaning soap/water and rinsed and squeezed it out, along with the other 3 blenders. 3 are okay, one ripped open. Not ok for a product I used and then cleaned for a total of 3-4 minutes. It must have been of a poor quality. I cannot tell if it will happen to the other 3 so soon. Other than that, these ARE very very soft and absorbent and do blend very well. They did a good job while damp. They had no chemically smell, and I would really like them as long as they would be durable, I would have no complaints at all. Their durability is questionable. As it is, I might go back to using the wedge shaped white ones. I requested a replacement and will update this review on their quality, I am hoping this was just a fluke. I really want to like these. In looking at my photo where you can see how the blender split, I can promise you nothing snagged it. It split just from being dampened and then squeezed. Hopefully this won’t happen again. The other 3 seem okay.

488,5.0 out of 5 stars BEST SUGAR WAX!,"You NEED this! Don’t get sucked into buying other brands (iykyk). This was exactly what I was looking for. I previously used another brand but it was so much more expensive. Luckily I found this. Negative reviews are mainly due to user error. Sugar waxing can be tricky at first, but once you practice it is very effective. This is high quality sugar wax, don’t think about it - just get it! My only complaint is that the lid was cracked upon arrival. Not sure how this will hold up over the next few months.

489,5.0 out of 5 stars WOW! Professional Quality!,"Wow! I never felt so compelled to rush to draft a review! I’m a licensed master aesthetician, 15 years in the professional beauty industry, and have been a certified Body Sugaring Practitioner for 8 years. I have experience with the top professional sugaring companies in this industry. I have to say, I was in a pinch and my order didn’t come in on time. I run a very busy medical aesthetics practice and have a slew of sugaring appointments this week. Regretfully, I took to Amazon prime. Most aestheticians especially Master/Medical Aestheticians are hardcore product snobs, because we only what the best, most  authentic, and highly performing ingredients in everything we use. Efficacy and how products react with the skin is everything to us. I looked over the ingredients here, looked at the way the product looked in the container, and it seemed this one, out of many others, seemed like the closest to what I use and would be delivered quickly, and would get me through my appointments. Boy, was I in for a pleasant surprise! I needed one for Brazilians and one for full leg services. So I purchased the Ultima and Ultra. I was looking for something equivalent to a firm and a soft. The sugaring paste came packed EXTREMELY professionally! The container the label the business cards EVERYTHING was extremely professional! Quite elegant I must add. I blended it with the bit of my other sugaring paste just in case I was disappointed. I did use my sugar paste warmer to bring it to the appropriate temperature and wow! Absolutely fabulous results! Just as good as my Tamera’s Sugaring Paste. For the pros wondering about this: I don’t think any sugaring paste can compare to Alexandria Professional’s , but if you’ve ever used Tamara’s Sugaring paste I’d say this sugaring paste is in a class of its own as well, but is definitely more comparable to Tamara’s. The Ultima is a true firm. The Ultra works more like a medium soft. Kinda wish I’d ordered the Gentle because I like soft sugar for the legs and I use the ancient technique. I don’t use this as a form of waxing so I don’t use any strips but I was worried the Gentle would work like Alexandria professional’s Kiss, which is a thinner sugar for people who use sugaring paste in place of soft wax. After using the Ultra, I think I will purchase the Gentle. I’m very excited about this product line. I’m surprised to see a product like this on Amazon because this isn’t for the general public, as one can gather by reading through the reviews (also just my opinion). This product is high quality and hands down a professional item for licensed Aestheticians and Cosmetologists that are trained Body Sugaring Practitioners. Otherwise, you wouldn’t know exactly how to maneuver this or would have bruises. Or you’d try to use this like it’s wax. It’s definitely not! Definitely am an instant fan, and will be reordering more. THANKS SUGARING FACTORY! Your products and packaging, even the way the product was packaged for delivery was exceptional. Love your vibe!

491,4.0 out of 5 stars It’s good,"So, I have done much research even though I am a beginner so it was very easy for me to use this product. The product comes HARD AS A ROCK and you need to get it out and warm it up and move it around with your hands. You do not need to microwave it unless u like thinner consistency because it is pretty thick. Only reason i put 4/5 is because it did not come with body powder but i just used flour.

492,"5.0 out of 5 stars If you fail, try try again","I feel compelled to write this review and share my experience. So after I had seen a few videos of how fantastic sugaring was and how easy the videos made it look, I said why not? So went to my favorite place to order all things, read reviews and placed an order. It arrives and im super excited! mind you I also ordered the sugaring powder because if your gonna do it, do it right! Sooo I proceed to follow instructions that came with it and lets say it was a messy sticky disaster. Luckily no matter how bad you mess up, it all comes off with warm water! Defeated, I chalked it up to, well I kinda just slapped it on to try it out didn't wash the skin, ect. My second attempt didn't go any better and I did wash the area, powdered I was all ready! I proceed to smear it on and again I can't get this stuff off! It's just all over the place, my fingers are stuck together with the wax stick in between. I was sooo frustrated, again defeated I wash it all off and put that torture molasses away for another day. When i decided to give this one more try i was determined to make this work! Set everything up and gave it a go. FAIL! As I cleaned up the mess and accepted failure, I swore never again to order stuff based on a few targeted videos. Bitter, I went into my Amazon acct and requested a refund to try and forget this fiasco. After a few hours had gone by, I just couldn't let this wax made of sugar get the best of me so I head to the place where you can can learn all things... YouTube. Now, I had watched a few other videos prior with no success. Then I came across videos from a Youtuber by the name abetweene, watched her videos like my life depended on it and had my AHA moment! Armed with my new found information, I gathered all my torture tools, prepped my skin because this wax made of sugar was not going to defeat me. As I spread this gold colored enemy of mine, when it was time to remove, where it had gone wrong all the other times I flicked it just as the video said and Voila! The whole time I was approaching this same way as traditional waxing but no my friends this is different, I had tried the flick before but the new videos I watched really helped and it's all in the flick. Now, I'm still trying to get down the ideal temp to make this more spreadable but let me tell you this is amazing. Large areas like legs is phenomenal because you can keep re using until its not sticky and the process is much faster. I waxed my legs about 2 weeks ago and since its waxed in the direction of the hair growth I feel it did a much better job at pulling the hair out opposed to breaking it because my legs are still smooth. Woohoo success!

493,5.0 out of 5 stars High quality and excellent value.,"Let me begin by pointing out a flaw that I've noticed with many loofah reviews here on Amazon. There seems to be this misconception that loofahs are meant to last forever and reviewers have been quick to rate them poorly if one falls apart before a year. With daily or semi-daily use, most loofahs aren't designed to last more than 3 months at most. Regardless of whether or not your loofah is still in good condition past that threshold you should still be replacing them around 2-3 months due to bacterial growth. Regardless of soap or body wash, mesh and foam still harbor bacteria and eventually it'll get to the point where you are bathing in your own filth. That is why you usually see shower loofahs sold as multi-packs. Now for the product review. These loofahs are some of the best that I've found thus far on Amazon! They are high quality and have a soft, silky texture that makes your showers feel a little more luxurious. The colors look great and should be able to match your bathroom decor without any issue (if you're concerned about that sort of thing). The first loofah from the pack lasted a full month and still looked nice. It broke down minimally and could have lasted another few weeks before it started to look bad, but I chose to start a new one. They all come in a frosted white carrying back with a drawstring at the top and everything was odorless. I mention this because I've had loofahs delivered in the past that arrived with strong plasticy, chemical-like smells. Honestly, you would be hard-pressed to find a higher quality loofah here on Amazon for the price. Once I've used them all up, I plan on purchasing these again in the future :).

506,5.0 out of 5 stars Great massager! See a difference in skin!,So I bought this based off reviews saying it helps with lymph node drainage and skin tightening. I've been using it for about 2-3wks now and I use it a lot. It def helps with puffiness and swollen lymph nodes. Instant relief under my ears and neckline. I use all the settings but mainly the red. It has def helped lift my skin on my neck and chin area. My skin under my chin and neck sag alittle. I broke my collar nine years ago and the pull of skin from my neck to shoulder from surgery left me with a turkey neck. Using this product along with retinol oils and face lifting cream on my neck and under jaw have really improved my face. I bet another couple months I'll be even happier.

508,4.0 out of 5 stars The best one I tried so far,"Like so many others, I was looking for a device that would help with some sagging skin and jaw sculpting. I tried a few different models. I wanted to know why some were $80 and others under $30. All have the lights right? Well, let me tell you there is a difference in quality. One unit I had to replace two times, not sure I am allowed to say the name but it's advertised all over social media for around $60. Amazon had the same unit for less money. This unit also had the micro-current option. I already own the Nu-Face which I love to use, but hate to use that sticky gel. I wanted an all-in-one that I could just use my skin cream. Ok, back to the first unit, it lasted one day and died. So I exchanged it, that one lasted 3 days and died. I ordered another unit, ""black/gold"" for around $80 and it felt great using it. But after 30 days of use, I saw no change at all so I returned it. I will be leaving reviews on those other units if you care to read them. Now about ""this unit"", so far I think this one is the best. As long as you are not expecting miracles. I see the mixed reviews and I will say how much of a change you see will depend on the person using it. If you are young with firm skin, yes this will improve the appearance of your skin. Maybe even tighten a bit. If you are older with very saggy skin, do not expect this to be your facelift. It may help firm just a bit if you are using very good firming skin care with the unit. Full disclosure, I am 67 and have always taken care of my skin. Even at my age, I do not have any wrinkles, mostly due to the skincare I used for years. However, gravity had to show up. I have some sagging at the jowls and jawline. No turkey neck yet and I hope this device will prevent that. What has this device done so far? After using it every day for 6 weeks, I can now go without makeup. I am constantly getting compliments on my skin and people always seem to think I am 15 years younger than my actual age. Is it due to this device alone? No, it's due to good genes and my skincare that I started in my 30's. I will say this device has made my skin glow, look smoother, and healthier. I use it along with different products that I alternate with. One product has retinol, another has skin-firming properties, another has Vit-C and then there are the moisturizers. One for day and one at night to go over the retinol serum. This device is so easy to use. I love using this while watching TV. It feels great, like a face massage. The blue light is cooling while the green and red light provide just the right amount of warmth. The massage works on all three colors. I can use this device for about 4 or 5 days before charging again. I do use all 3 color lights. It has a timer built in that beeps when you should move on to the next section. I normally do each color two times over each section of my face, jaw, and neck. It has helped with the jawline, but not like they show in the picture, but maybe in time. Again, if I were in my 30's maybe it would sculpt a jawline. I have hopes even at my age. I feel that this device will complement whatever skin care you are using. I think the warmth of the massage helps to get that skin creme into the skin. Give this unit a try but use it with at least a good moisturizer. Be diligent, use it every day for the month. Take before and after pictures. Amazon has a great return policy, even if it does not sculpt the way you want, your skin will still have a healthy glow.
