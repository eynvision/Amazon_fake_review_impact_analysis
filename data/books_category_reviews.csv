1,5.0 out of 5 stars Unique!,"What a unique plot line!  With characters you want to meet and situations that are hard to fathom, this book had me gripped from start to finish!  While dark and intense, the characters bring a life of their own that give the story the personal touch needed to carry you through. It’s hard to believe that this beautifully worded book is Tierney’s first.  With a slight hint at the end, I’m hoping to see more of Ava in future stories! Glad that this was a dual read/listen because I didn’t want to put it down!  Thank you to Henry Holt, Macmillan Audio and NetGalley for and ARC and ALC of this book.

2,4.0 out of 5 stars Creepy Folklore Mystery,"Ava is not like other 14-year-olds. She has a unique interest in the rate at which different animals decompose. While out collecting roadkill one evening, she stumbles across the body of a fellow classmate, which leads to her making an anonymous call to the police. Ava’s curiosities don’t end there and she finds herself fully enraptured in the case. DEADLY ANIMALS by Marie Tierney is a debut like no other! With smart characters who are so steady in who they are and a creepy mystery drenched in folklore, I found this story so incredibly easy to visualize and found myself sneaking through the woods alongside Ava. I loved the relationship between Ava and Detective Delahaye (give me more more more!!) and I’m hoping we get to see more of this duo in Tierney’s future work! I docked a star for some pacing issues and for guessing who the killer was very early on, but, overall, this was such a fantastic novel! Read more",12 Nov 2024,Hannah O.

3,5.0 out of 5 stars Fresh approach to crime with a compelling heroine,"An incredible debut. 'Deadly Animals' shines with its fresh approach to crime. Set in 1981 Birmingham, a precocious 13-year-old girl becomes an unlikely expert to a police investigation into the murder of her classmates. Marie Tierney creates as fantastic heroine in Ava, a self-assured autodidactic with an uncanny knowledge of biology, animal decomposition (thanks to her animal body farm), mimicry and illustration. She has a sharp vocabulary, but you can still see how she is still a child. I adored the friendship with her best friend Josh and all the teenage complications that comes with it. DS Seth Delahaye is a persistant but laid back and, refreshingly, is pleased by the Ava's insight and comes to rely upon it. The writing is tight with short sharp chapters, with characters that are absorbing. The pace is perfect with a slow-burn tension. I worked out pretty early who the killer was and I could feel the slow pit of dread as Ava and Seth seperately come to the shocking realisation. This is definitely a top crime book for 2024. I would love to see more Ava, or perhaps a grown up Ava. But I know I'm being greedy. Thanks to Bonnier Books UK/Zaffre and NetGalley for the ARC.

4,4.0 out of 5 stars Deadly Animals by Marie Tierney,"Thirteen year old Ava Bonney is unlike most other children her age. She has an intellect way beyond her years and a morbid fascination with death and decay. Her neglectful mother is more interested in her own criminal boyfriend than her young daughters so Ava has plenty of opportunity to indulge her morbid interests. Which she does, creeping out of the house in the dead of night to scoop roadkill from the side of the road and move it to her own animal body farm. One night, checking on a particularly interesting specimen, Ava makes a startling discovery. The body of a fourteen-year-old boy from her school. But this is only the start. A sadistic killer is at work in Ava’s community targeting young boys. Ava watches as the police struggle to link the evidence and repeatedly fail to catch the culprit. Realising they need her help and knowledge, she takes it upon herself to assist. Can a thirteen-year-old girl stop a vicious killer before more local children meet a horrific, grisly end…? Deadly Animals is a superb debut novel from a writer to watch. Crime fiction fans, get this book on your radar and do everything in your power to get hold of a copy. Ava Bonney is very different to her classmates. Many see her as weird, whereas a small number of people see how exceptionally bright and switched on she really is. One of those people being Detective Seth Delahaye. I’ve read a number of other reviews of this book and one of the things which stands out is how fond and how much readers admire the character of Ava. And I agree. She’s beyond her years and incredibly astute. As the main character in this tale, she totally steals the show. But for me, my favourite character was Detective Delahaye. There’s a kindness and an understanding there that I immediately warmed to. Whilst many of his police colleagues aren’t prepared to listen to what a thirteen year old girl thinks, Delahaye does the opposite. He listens, he takes heed. He risks his career and his reputation and because of that decision to trust his gut, they finally start to make progress in the case. Would I recommend this book? I would, yes. Deadly Animals is a slow-burn character driven crime fiction novel where the plot moves at an enticing pace and takes the reader down an unexpected path. The characters and their beautifully scripted relationships absolutely made this novel for me. I loved the friendship between Ava and John. The two besties forensically examine the evidence before them (what little they have as minors and civilians!), coming up with workable theories which they then pass onto the police via anonymous phone calls (cue Mrs Poshy-Snob, one of Ava’s many character creations!). I enjoyed that the book was set in the early 1980s and that the setting was Birmingham. I firmly believed in the Birmingham the author paints for her readers. It’s a dark tale with a fairly large twist in the tale. I certainly didn’t see the details of the twist coming but I was highly suspicious of one character from fairly early on. It turned out I was right to be suspicious. Despite guessing whodunit my enjoyment wasn’t spoilt at all — I appreciated that the author decided to take her story in a very different direction. It makes the book stand out in my memory even more. All in all, Deadly Animals is a gripping, engaging story with strong characters and an intriguing, different edge to it. A well-written debut, original and beautifully dark. I will be looking out for more from this author in the future. Recommended.

7,,I was lucky enough to be gifted a copy of this from my online book club. It had a really brilliant storyline. Ava's character was great. This isn't my usual genre and probably not the type of book that I would read again. But that is my preference and not against the book. It was very well written and I can see why it has won prizes.

The plot would sound bonkers if I explained it but at no point did it feel that way as I devoured (pun not intended!) this book. The characters are fantastic and well rounded.

10,5.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful stories and truths - How Great is that?,There are no disappointments in this wonderful autobiography! You know when someone whose work you love writes a blah-blah book - and you’re heartbroken? This is not that! Ina Garten fans (like me!!) can rest assured that this book delivers on all levels - and she shares some classic recipes to boot. I also love Mrs. Garten’s attention to telling the uncomfortable truths of her real life - and with so much wisdom. This book was a wonderful read but also super helpful.

13,4.0 out of 5 stars Ina knows a thing or two,"I love to read autobiographies. Ina not only tells a great story, but has truly led a fascinating life despite a difficult and heart wrenching childhood of emotional neglect. I was 100% on board for the ride until the last 10% of the book when there was much celebrity name dropping. So many of us are tired of the celebrity culture. I love Ina’s cookbooks. I haven’t watched her show, but I might try the original series. Not interested in watching fake cooking with superstar celebrities. Excellent personal stories about Ina and her husband. She shares many joyful and insightful life nuggets, that if you can stop around 90% you’ll have a very enjoyable read. Thank you, Ina!

14,5.0 out of 5 stars Pure Ina,"I preordered and started reading the moment it arrived, the on the plane and final 3:00 am in my hotel room. The first part of the book, maybe 90 pages or so covers Ina’s early life. This part of the book felt a little like the editors made her tell this part of her story. While it certainly provided some context for her life, it didn’t feel like it was Ina’s typical warm, engaging style. That all changed when we entered the “Barefoot” years. From here the book revealed her passion, tenacity, style and was easily relatable. Ina writes with warmth and humor; she makes you feel what she feels. The book draws you in and somehow makes you reflect on your own “luck” and readiness. This is a wonderful book on so many levels and I can see myself going back and rereading portions whenever I need a reminder to live my life with a little more grace, style and humor.

There are plenty of celebrity chefs these days but I find that Ina is one of the few whose recipes I can actually use as written because they are healthy, made with simple and easy to find ingredients and with foolproof, easy to follow directions.

23,4.0 out of 5 stars Good drama/twisty mystery,"“The Last One At the Wedding” by Jason Remulak is definitely different than “Hidden Pictures”, but it is a quick and entertaining read.  The story never drags, and the characters and location are all very interesting and, in my opinion, well developed.  I certainly recommend this book. I do have one problem with the plot, which is why I deducted a star.  The father, Frank, has been estranged from his young adult daughter, Maggie, for about three years.  One day, she contacts him out of the blue to tell him that she is getting married, and he’s invited!  What’s more, she invites him to Boston to have dinner with her and her new fiancé, who comes from a very wealthy tech family.  Frank is obviously overjoyed at the opportunity to become a part of his daughter’s life again.  However, as soon as he meets her fiancé, he starts becoming suspicious that things are not quite right.  His suspicion seems a bit … over the top?  It’s persistent and unrelenting, and he does not hesitate to share his misgivings with his daughter.  This cause some friction, and it seems like an odd choice of direction for the plot considering that they JUST reconciled. However, perhaps Frank is only being overly protective since he just got back into Maggie’s life, and he wants to make sure, as a caring parent, that she is make the right choice.  We eventually find out, later in the book, the cause of their 3 year communication gap.  Once this is revealed, I felt that Frank’s concern and protective behavior made absolutely no sense.  I won’t reveal any details, but I could never reconcile this part of the story in my head. This is still a pretty good read.  But some of the plot is a little odd in places.  No supernatural elements like “Hidden Pictures”, but that wasn’t a problem for me at all. Read more",13 Nov 2024,J.

I enjoyed the pacing much more than Rekulak's other book (Hidden Pictures), and was curious about the mystery at the book's center. Frank was a mostly likeable character, his sister annoyed me from time to time, and I expected more from Maggie, who just felt rather flat. Things took longer than I may have liked, and the ending was completely lackluster. 3/5 stars Read more",05 Nov 2024,Emily Simpson,3.0,B0CPWT13KW,"https://www.amazon.com/Last-One-Wedding-Novel-ebook/dp/B0CPWT13KW/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

26,4.0 out of 5 stars DRAMA NOT HORROR but still a great read !,"‘24 - 4 STARS DESCRIPTION : *** THIS BOOK IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT GENRE THAN HIDDEN PICTURES WHICH WAS A HORROR/THRILLER; THIS BOOK IS A FAMILY DRAMA/MURDER *** Frank Szatowski is shocked when his daughter, Maggie, calls him for the first time in three years. He was convinced that their estrangement would become permanent. He’s even more surprised when she invites him to her upcoming wedding in New Hampshire. Frank is ecstatic, and determined to finally make things right.  He arrives to find that the wedding is at a private estate—very secluded, very luxurious, very much out of his league. It seems that Maggie failed to mention that she’s marrying Aidan Gardner, the son of a famous tech billionaire. Feeling desperately out of place, Frank focuses on reconnecting with Maggie and getting to know her new family. But it’s difficult: Aidan is withdrawn and evasive; Maggie doesn’t seem to have time for him; and he finds that the locals are disturbingly hostile to the Gardners. Frank needs to know more about this family his daughter is marrying into, but if he pushes too hard, he could lose Maggie forever.  A pulse-pounding exploration of family ties, secret agendas, and the possibility of redemption—a thrill-ride like no other. REVIEW : First book by this author was Hidden Pictures (‘22 - 5 Stars - Horror). Earned Triple Kindle Reward Points with this purchase. This book is a totally different genre than Hidden Pictures.  This one is definitely an interesting family drama with a twisty murder mixed-in.  Very enjoyable but two totally different genres.  Same great writing that really moved the plot along and keeps you reading and guessing where it was going.  Once i got over the fact that this book was not a horror/thriller, I settled-in and was totally entertained.  My 4-star review was almost 5 stars, but I felt that ending was a little rushed and the very last paragraphs made me re-read the last few pages to make sure I didn’t’ miss anything.

32,,"Zuerst muss ich ganz deutlich sagen, dass diese Geschichte ein komplett anderes Genre ist als Hidden Pictures. Hierbei geht es um ein Familiendrama und Mord, also was ganz anderes, worauf ich dennoch sehr gespannt gewesen bin und ich auch hohe Erwartungen hatte. Jason Rekulak hat wie immer einen richtigen tollen Schreibstil und ich bin auch diesmal durch die Seiten geflogen, vor allem weil es auch nicht ellenlange Kapitel gibt. Das mag ich wirklich sehr gerne und ich finde, dass der Autor richtig gut schreiben kann. Es gab kaum Längen, trotz der kleinen Vorgeschichte am Anfang und man wollte wissen, was zwischen Frank und seiner Tochter passiert ist und wieso sie so überstürzt heiratet (einen reichen jungen Mann), denn Frank hegen in der Geschichte eigene Zweifel und hat durchgehend ein ungutes Gefühl, zumal es eine Verbindung zwischen seinem zukünftigen Schwiegersohn und einem unerklärten Verschwinden einer Frau gibt. Ich fand es recht spannend und auch interessant und ich habe die Geschichte gerne verfolgt und bin dementsprechend gespannt gewesen wie sich die Geschichte auflösen würde. Zudem konnte man hier gute Theorien aufstellen, sodass ich mich mit @syl_buecherwurm gut austauschen konnte.❤️ Schön und gut. Wo bleibt deine Kritik? Tatsächlich gibt es hier Kritik, denn das Ende fand ich etwas ernüchternd, ist sehr abrupt gewesen und fand ich leider nicht sehr gelungen. Es löst sich zwar alles logisch auf, aber irgendwie habe ich da einen großen Knall erwartet, der leider ausgeblieben ist, was aber auch an meiner Erwartungshaltung gelegen haben könnte. Dennoch insgesamt eine gute und spannende Geschichte, die ich gerne gelesen habe und euch auch weiterempfehlen kann. Derzeit habe ich noch keinen deutschen Release gesehen.

35,"5.0 out of 5 stars Gladwell Revisits Tipping Points, and looks at the dark side","Malcolm Gladwell returns by revisiting the topic of his first book: The Tipping Point.  As he states right at the beginning (pg 7) ""I want to look at the underside of the possibilites I explored so long ago.  If the world can be moved by just the slightest push, then the person who knows where and when to push has real power."" Gladwell writes the book in a style that will be familiar with anyone who has read his previous books.  He is a gifted storyteller and each facet of the argument he is trying to make is introduced with a story. (Spoilers from here on out) Summary: Gladwell tries to find the mechanisms that explain the opioid epidemic in the US (prescription and illicit drugs).  Gladwell shows how Purdue Pharma, along with guidance from the consulting firm McKinsey, leveraged certain concepts about the nature of epidemics to create the current crisis. Through the process he explores concepts including, ""small town variation,"" ""overstories""  - which he explains is his word for something resembling a Zeitgeist, revisits ""tipping points"" and monocultures among other topics. Central to his perspective is the way that stories shape our perspective, and how those who tell stories can shape the public consciousness.  He gives a number of examples that capture this vividly. Along the way he grapples with some knotty moral questions.  He explores engaging with minor discrimination to prevent vicious discrimination.  He raises the issue of better methods of identification of potentially leading to profiling disadvantaged groups (in his primary example, the COVID virus was more likely to spread from people who were elderly and overweight.)  He has an interesting perspective on Ivy League schools like Harvard using sports teams to maintain the student balance that they desire. Why should you read this book? - Gladwell is a writer who is not scared to ask big questions or explore knotty issues.  His discussions about discrimination and about the way that the introduction of Purdue's OxyContin gummies actually exacerbated the situation raises some challenging questions. - Gladwell's writing style is engaging and fun to read.  I read the book over a 24-hour period and am sure many others will do the same - Gladwell brings up anecdotes and stories that are not well known and will likely cause you to reconsider how you see things that you thought you knew. Some other notes: - Gladwell has stated at public lectures that looking back, there are aspects of his earlier writing that he no longer agrees with.  Gladwell is someone who is clearly constantly exploring and learning and is not afraid to change his perspective on topics.  I view his writing as deeply thought provoking but do not assume they are hard facts.  (In this book, I have a hard time seeing how Madden's triplicate forms would be considered an 'overstory' rather than a technical reality that impacted the drug epidemic. - Many of Gladwell's previous books have introduced ideas that were widely adopted (tipping point is just one of them), so I would expect ideas from this book to circulate pretty widely. - This book does not discuss how social media impacts public opinion.  It never mentions 'fake news,' contemporary politics, or other aspects of modern society (in 2024) that I had expected from the title. Is it for children: The book talks about Medicare fraud, drug abuse, suicide, White Flight and the Holocaust, so there are quite a few heavy topics.  I do not recall any profanity or sexual content. Conclusion: Gladwell has put out another fascinating book that spans a wide range of topics and is sure to leave you thinking.  It is a quick, engaging read, even as some of the topics are quite heavy. As with Gladwell's other books, it is sometimes hard to tell if everything seems to be tying together neatly because in fact they do, or if it is Gladwell's skill as a writer that makes it seem so.  Reviewing the notes I wrote on the book, there were aspects that I was not sure fit perfectly, though that may be an indication of the limits of my understanding of the book, rather than a flaw in the content. Overall, it is a fun read that is thought provoking.  And as noted, because Gladwell is so widely read, it seems likely that elements of this book will become widely known and shared.  Interestingly, he touches on some ideas from The Tipping Point but almost never references them directly or even acknowledges which ideas he discussed in his earlier book.

36,4.0 out of 5 stars Good but not great,"This is a revisit to the original tipping point. I wish it was either an update or entirely new. It is between both, and in my opinion misses the mark a bit. Lacks some of the conversational style of this author’s other books, which I missed. It seems kind of forced, but still presents its arguments in a clear and compelling way. That’s why I chose 4 stars. Read more",10 Oct 2024,L.

"
37,5.0 out of 5 stars Truth is in the details.,"The title of this book could have been: “The Etiology of Change.” Etiology is a medical term meaning cause. And I use it here because Gladwell, as he did in the first Tipping Point, frames change in terms of an epidemic. The tipping point, of course, is the mass at which a duality moves inevitably, and often quickly, in the other direction. It’s important because all of existence is defined by dualities. Up is always accompanied by down. Left doesn’t exist without right. And so it is with the many social trends, such as housing, college acceptance, and the opioid crisis in which there are identifiable groups of individuals which share a distinguishing common trait (e.g. race, religion, addiction) within the larger group. The objective I believe the author is seeking is how to restore balance when imbalance shows its ugly mug. The search for balance is ubiquitous to nature because of the universal existence of dualities. The topics that Gladwell addresses (e.g., Why does Harvard have a women’s rugby team?) are as obscure as those he shared in the first book. And that alone makes the book informative and entertaining. He definitely has a nose for the obscurely interesting. And, as in all his books, the research is thorough and impeccable. He does, however, spend a lot of time quoting third parties in order to build his case. Perhaps more than necessary. I personally wish he spent more time expanding his conclusions. He has a strong enough reputation that he can assume our acceptance of his source observations. His conclusion, as I read it, is that we can understand far-reaching but perplexing social trends by looking into the details. The truth, or at least the greater truth, always hides there. And if we can uncover it, we can address the problem. Resolving the problem may not always be seen as “fair,” however. The solution, as he notes, is often counter-intuitive to society’s pre-defined solutions to the problem. And that’s where the book sometimes just stops. There are few real prescriptions for how to overcome that hurdle. I suspect Gladwell considered that to be beyond the scope of the book, but it did leave me wondering, “Okay, but what do I do with that?” To me, this is a book about context. We do tend to oversimplify everything in our everyday public discourse. And certainly in this election year the oversimplification is at a fevered pitch. We’re just yelling myths at each other. The world is far more complicated and nuanced than either political party is currently acknowledging. In that regard, this book is timely although Gladwell does not enter the political fray at any level. The book is more investigative journalism than opinion piece. Gladwell is lucid and profoundly curious. The book is an easy read, and you should be able to finish the book in just a couple of days. It is worth the time.

38,5.0 out of 5 stars Another great one!,"I fell in-love with Gladwell's writing when I read ""Outliers"" many years ago. His style of writing is brilliant, it's easy for those of us who are not academics to follow along but still chock full of interesting ideas and facts. This is the sequel to, ""The Tipping Point"" and I very much enjoyed reading it. The way he was able to tie together so many things and string them along was a masterclass in writing. I found his tidbits regarding Buffalo to be interesting, having previously spent a majority of my life there and I always found the health care to be like living in a 3rd world country compared to larger cities I have lived in (Seattle, Dallas). The lack of care my own Mother received when she suffered a heart attack resulted in her death, but your mileage may vary. I digress.... it is a fantastic book and I always feel sad when I finish one of his because I enjoy his writing style so much. Hope he has many more books left in him!

45,"5.0 out of 5 stars Provocative, empathetic, and masterfully-written","Ta-Nehisi Coates writes this book in a deeply personal way that is both empathetic, lyrical, and insightful. His curiosity takes him on three journeys. In his first journey, he visits Dakar, Senegal on his first trip to Africa — or the ""Last Stop,"" as he calls it, before his enslaved ancestors were shipped off to the New World. One of the most poignant parts is when he's in Dakar and realizes he is ""seeking out the solace of [his own] self-reflection."" In other words, he is visiting the ""ghosts"" of his ancestors and not seeing the actual people who are there now. It's a solipsistic admission but it's powerful. In his journey to North Carolina, Coates is visiting a teacher activist who is trying to teach his book. She's willing to risk her job to keep his book as part of her curriculum and not have it banned. In the final journey, he visits Occupied Palestine and Israel. With empathy, he explores navigates the emotional terrain of Yad Vashem. He also witnesses the Israeli apartheid system first-hand. He asks questions. His curiosity and conscience help him to grapple with the cognitive dissonance of the harsh reality he sees Palestinians living against the stories he'd blindly accepted prior to visiting.

46,5.0 out of 5 stars Coates Unveils Parallels Between American Racism and Palestinian Struggles,"Coates’s latest work is a powerful exploration of historical and ongoing injustices, drawing parallels between racial oppression in America and in Israeli, which has come to a boil in the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His narrative challenges readers to confront uncomfortable truths and question long-held beliefs. Through his lens as a Black American, Coates provides a unique perspective on power dynamics and systemic racism. His writing is both profound and unsettling, urging readers to acknowledge past and present racialized violence and seek universal justice. While some may find his analysis provocative, Coates's commitment to truth-telling is both courageous and necessary. Unfortunately, some critics have resorted to unfairly attacking Coates's character in an attempt to discredit him, largely due to their discomfort with the truths he presents. Ironically, these disingenuous critiques only serve to prove his point, highlighting how the darkest times in America still resonate worldwide. The parallels he draws are not just historical—they are lived realities that persist today, underscoring the urgency of his message for justice and equality. As Benjamin Franklin wisely noted, ""Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as those who are."" Coates's work shines a light on injustices that reverberate through our society, urging us all to share in the outrage and demand change. His exploration of these issues is not just a call for awareness but a rallying cry for collective action towards justice and equality.

47,5.0 out of 5 stars Hauntingly Exquisite & Wise,"I had forgotten how amazing and powerful Coates’ work is. This book was of particular interest to me because of some things I have in common with the author.  I lived in Baltimore during the decade of the 80’s not far from the neighborhood where Coates was growing up, and I have been to both Senegal and Palestine.  Like Coates, I traveled throughout Israel and Palestine, met many pro-Palestinian activists (Palestinian, Bedouin, and Israeli), and went to Yad Vashem and explored the old city of Jerusalem by myself. Coates’ reflections on these places feel like he tapped into my inchoate thoughts and feelings and turned them into achingly beautiful poetry. We are so very lucky to share time and space with this stellar talent who speaks truth to power in such exquisite prose.  George Orwell would be very proud.

52,,Writer Ta-Nehisi Coates adds to his sterling corpus this investigation of his “African” roots (a visit to Senegal) contrasting it with 10 days shared equally between Palestine and Israel coming to terms with the ugliness of the Zionist ethnic cleansing (the Naqba of 1948 and ever since) and the way in which Vad Yashem (?) acts as a kind of fig leaf cover for the crimes committed by Zionists against Palestinians. I admire and respect the way in which he interrogates himself and the things he admits missing in first sight. I am shocked yet also unsurprised in the US of these times that his clear sight is not welcome and his books suffer censorship by those who fear the revelations. This could easily be the book of the year 2024.

55,4.0 out of 5 stars Erdrich is my hero,"After reading handfuls of her novels, this is what I want to say about Louise Erdrich. She finds the little things in life and describes them in the simplest, most perfect ways. Many times I am reading her books and thinking to myself, she hits the nail on the head with all her little descriptions of every day life. It is something beautiful that many writers try to duplicate but usually miss their mark. Also she expands on the grey in life and makes it glorious and relatable . When I read her books I find myself thinking - most people aren’t all good or all bad. Good people make bad choices. There is grey in the world. I don’t know how to explain it other than that, if you read her stuff you know what I mean. Her novels very rarely have a “plot”. There’s a story line there but it’s usually thin, and her stories are tightly strung together by the rich depth of her characters. She makes reading fun, thoughtful, enjoyable. I have read and reread many of her books because, at the end of the day, she makes her readers feel something. In every book. I liked, but did not love The Mighty Red. Maybe on a second read I would enjoy more. It’s not my favorite Erdrich book. However. It is an excellent book and one I think people will appreciate and enjoy if they give it a chance.

57,3.0 out of 5 stars Erdrich Settles for Easy Resolution of Conflict,"The title refers to the Red River, which separates North Dakota and Minnesota. The Red River valley is famous for sugar beets, but it’s not exactly THE MIGHTY RED, although it does flood periodically during the spring. One of the principal characters, Crystal Poe, drives a sugar beet truck; otherwise the book doesn’t have all that much to do with sugar beets or the river. Gary Geist is in love with Kismet Poe, Crystal’s daughter. So is Hugo, Kismet’s best friend. She marries Gary, but only because he asks her. She feels she’s made a terrible mistake. Hugo strikes out for the fracking wells in North Dakota to save up enough money to win Kismet over. He doesn’t seem aware of Crystal decision to marry Gary, or if he is, he thinks he can lure her away. The other conflict in the story has to do with Martin, Crystal’s husband, who runs off with some money meant for charity. Gary and the other young men in the story are tortured by what happened to their friends in a terrible snow mobile accident. Gary was racing his machine towards a frozen lake and a wire fence. The other boys crashed their machines trying to catch up to Gary and were killed. Some of this stuff just doesn’t seem very realistic. Martin steals all that money but doesn’t seem to suffer the consequences anybody else would when he returns. Kismet doesn’t seem to know what the heck she wants. It seems like Erdrich went for the easy choices when she decided on resolution of conflicts.

64,5.0 out of 5 stars Great book,"I give the book 4.75 stars.  I have really liked John Lewis from when I learned about him.  However, I don't remember learning about him as a young person.  I have always been fascinated by the civil rights movement. I am a gen xer.  I grew up learning about Martin Luther King.  I remember thinking how indebted we should be to him.  After reading this book, I feel John Lewis did so MUCH for this nation.  I really believe everyone needs to be educated on John Lewis. This was probably the longest book I have ever read.  It took me about 3 weeks to read it.  I always wanted to keep reading this book.  This book is more than a book on John Lewis.  This is a book on civil rights, politics, presidents, illness, perseverance, history, racism, current politics, and so much more. This is the book to read if you want to learn more about Nixon, Reagan, Carter, Bush, Obama. Trump, Biden, Pelosi, Marin Luther King, Israel, Palestine, student protests, and so MUCH more. The book has so MUCH information.  Part of me wanted it to be two books ( and part of me was glad it was one).  There is so much information in the book.  I don't think you could take any information out.  The chapters are long.  Again, I don't know if it would have worked if they were shorter The book shows the human side to John Lewis ( and other figures).  I really felt I got to know him reading this book.  It doesn't make anyone perfect.  We all are human. I think this book should be a required reading for an American history ( college) class.  I do hope a movie is made from this book ( even though I know it will have to leave a lot out). I am so thankful to the author for writing the book.  I am so thankful I got the opportunity to read this book.  I would really like to see the author on a book tour.

65,5.0 out of 5 stars Brings the beloved community to life,"Like many Americans, John Lewis’ casket coming across the Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, in 2020 evoked tears in me. He was one of the last great leaders of the 1960s civil rights movement to die. With the Black Lives Matter movement in the streets, the baton had been passed to a new generation. I grew up a white Republican in conservative South Carolina and did not knew who John Lewis was until much later in life. I’ve learned to appreciate him deeply and have studied his life in detail through books. I’m glad to add this book to my list. In fact, I continually slowed myself down during the last two chapters because I had to read through tears of appreciation for this great man. I wanted to proceed – such was the strength of David Greenberg’s portrayal – but I also wanted my heart to continue to explore the depths of Lewis’ character. I wanted to carry it into my life today. This book attempts to create the first great posthumous biography of Lewis’ life. It wants to become “the book” to go to on his life for future historians to plum through. For what my vote is worth, I think it succeeds. Although Lewis’ life was surrounded by politics, its portrayal is relatively balanced and even praises Lewis’ opponents at times. Thus, it avoids potential pitfalls of petty partisanship that make it a reliable account of Lewis’ deep character. I’m grateful for the author’s work and for the many collaborations that made this work possible. I hope it will prove a market success while preserving critical history for the ages. As long as people struggle against bigotry’s ignorance, the spirit of John Lewis will live on. As long as the paths of nonviolence and love receive priority over raw power, the spirit of John Lewis will triumph. His life deserves 700 pages to chronicle it, and though the time investment is heavy, readers’ spirits will benefit from collaborating with John’s spirit. I could feel his personality – his humor, his dancing, his resolution, his decency – coming through the pages as I sought to learn from his strength. His vision of the “beloved community,” now sadly fading in America’s consciousness, will continue as long as people read this book and those like it. This book should receive a large, diverse audience among thoughtful citizens. I hope young people, disillusioned with the shortsightedness of some current political leaders, will take the time to read it. I hope college classes and church groups will take the opportunity to meditate on his magnanimity. In a world that seems to quickly diverge instead of converge, I hope this book offers a vision of unity and common humanity that John Lewis represented. And I hope more people will be moved to tears like me because that means that John’s life will continue to teach us all. Read more",11 Oct 2024,Scott J.

66,5.0 out of 5 stars An Epic Life,"This book, the first full-length biography of John Lewis, is a worthy addition to the library of biographies on civil rights heroes. Greenberg focuses as much on what Lewis achieved after the movement's classic era ended as he does on the sit-ins and speeches of the early 1960s. He does so in order to show how Lewis was able to take the moral certitude of the movement and use it within the context of American electoral politics, not always successfully but in a way that few others managed to do. Compelling, nuanced and full of urgency, this is a book that any reader of postwar American history needs to pick up.

The pages on the Civil Rights movement are completely gripping -- you can feel yourself at the marches and sit-ins with Lewis himself.  But the later chapters on Lewis's career in Congress are fascinating and rich in detail.  I particularly enjoyed learning about his relationship with different Democratic presidents -- Clinton (great friendship), Carter (uneasy), Obama (in the middle).

69,5.0 out of 5 stars An uplifting read that will warm your heart,"In 1920s Brooklyn, Goldie Stern is working in her father’s pharmacy when her mother tragically dies from diabetes.  It is only a few months later that insulin is brought to the market, further magnifying both Goldie’s grief and the importance of modern medicine.  While Goldie’s father, Solomon, is strictly about the medicine, his sister, Esther, brings unconventional remedies for the spirit and soul when she moves in.  Goldie is at first skeptical, but is eventually drawn to her Aunt Esther’s alternative remedies when she sees them work.  After all, where was modern medicine when her mother needed it?  There are, however, rules regarding Esther’s elixirs that Goldie unfortunately learns the hard way. In 1987, Goldie is now Augusta: a feisty, retired pharmacist who never married after having her heart broken sixty years earlier by Irving Rivkin, a delivery boy from her father’s pharmacy who fell head over heels for Augusta before suddenly disappearing with another woman.  Augusta, on the cusp of turning 80, moves into a retirement community in South Florida recommended by her niece.  When Augusta hears a man call her “Goldie,” she is shocked to find Irving resides at the same retirement community she is settling in to.  Two things become immediately clear: Irving is still very much smitten with Augusta and Augusta is still very much angry with Irving.  But was a magical elixir really to blame for their heartbreak, or was it perhaps something even darker? Loigman does a seamless job weaving dual timelines together and delivers another heartwarming story about reclaimed love and magic.

72,4.0 out of 5 stars A TWISTY TALE...,"On the cusp of turning eighty, newly retired pharmacist Augusta Stern is adrift. When she relocates to Rallentando Springs—an active senior community in southern Florida—she unexpectedly crosses paths with Irving Rivkin, the delivery boy from her father’s old pharmacy—and the man who broke her heart sixty years earlier. As a teenager growing up in 1920’s Brooklyn, Augusta’s role model was her father, Solomon Stern, the trusted owner of the local pharmacy and the neighborhood expert on every ailment. But when Augusta’s mother dies and Great Aunt Esther moves in, Augusta can’t help but be drawn to Esther’s curious methods. As a healer herself, Esther offers Solomon’s customers her own advice—unconventional remedies ranging from homemade chicken soup to a mysterious array of powders and potions. As Augusta prepares for pharmacy college, she is torn between loyalty to her father and fascination with her great aunt, all while navigating a budding but complicated relationship with Irving. Desperate for clarity, she impulsively uses Esther’s most potent elixir with disastrous consequences. Disillusioned and alone, Augusta vows to reject Esther’s enchantments forever. Sixty years later, confronted with Irving, Augusta is still haunted by the mistakes of her past. What happened all those years ago and how did her plan go so spectacularly wrong? Did Irving ever truly love her or was he simply playing a part? And can Augusta reclaim the magic of her youth before it’s too late? My Thoughts: As I wandered the journey in The Love Elixir of Augusta Stern, I was captured by the characters in their past and present moments. In alternating narratives, we learn more about their lives. It didn’t take long for me to hope for good things to come, and to see how the magic of how love could be created by an elixir…but could also go wrong along the way. I loved how a great conclusion came for these characters, even after many years apart. 4.5 stars. *** Read more",19 Oct 2024,Laurel-Rain Snow,4.0,B0CQHNH4VS,"https://www.amazon.com/Love-Elixir-Augusta-Stern-Novel-ebook/dp/B0CQHNH4VS/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

73,5.0 out of 5 stars Second Chances,"I don't even know where to start. I loved this beautiful, and delightful story. Magical, witty book that made me laugh and cry. It was a book that I was unable to put down. This story is set between two timelines, 1920's Brooklyn, NY and 1980's Florida. Brownsville, Brooklyn in the 1920's as Augusta was growing up. Her mother has passed away. She works in her father's pharmacy during her teenage years, and falling in love with the delivery boy who works for her father. Mysterious Aunt Esther has arrived to help the family. Her holistic medical practices or should I say magical practices are unconventional. 1980's and Augusta a pharmacist finally at 80 years old has retired. She moves to a retirement community in Florida. She discovers two childhood friends living there and life gets interesting. Aunt Esther's chicken soup and other foods from my childhood had me remember ing my grandmothers cooking. How I miss all those wonderful meals. A truly unforgettable and heartwarming story.

I would tell you more, but I might spoil not only this book for you, but also the previous one, if you hadn't got around to reading it yet.

80,5.0 out of 5 stars INTENSE!,"Anna Williams-Bonner has taken care of business. That is to say, she’s taken care of her husband, bestselling novelist Jacob Finch Bonner, and laid to rest those anonymous accusations of plagiarism that so tormented him. Now she is living the contented life of a literary widow, enjoying her husband’s royalty checks in perpetuity, but for the second time in her life, a work of fiction intercedes, and this time it’s her own debut novel, The Afterword. After all, how hard can it really be to write a universally lauded bestseller? But when Anna publishes her book and indulges in her own literary acclaim, she begins to receive excerpts of a novel she never expected to see again, a novel that should no longer exist. That it does means something has gone very wrong, and someone out there knows far too much: about her late brother, her late husband, and just possibly… Anna, herself. What does this person want and what are they prepared to do? She has come too far, and worked too hard, to lose what she values most: the sole and uncontested right to her own story. And she is, by any standard, a master storyteller. My Thoughts: The Sequel brings the reader along on an intense ride, as the widow of a man with literary acclaim writes her own novel. And then begins to sort through the plagiarism issues and assorted harassment complaints about her husband’s work. Soon we come to realize, however, that Anna has her own secrets and dark issues that plague her, leading to darkness and violence along the way to sorting things out. By the end, we come to learn the unexposed truths of the literary couple.

81,4.0 out of 5 stars Even more compelling and addictive than The Plot (4.5 stars)!,"If you haven’t read The Plot yet, STOP READING NOW! While I’ve done my best to avoid any spoilers, there will inevitably be a few substantial hints that would ruin the first book in this series. A masterful follow-up to The Plot, The Sequel happily took me back into the twisty world of Ms. Korelitz’s mind. This time, however, the main character was even more compelling, addictive, and utterly all-consuming. Picking up pretty much right after the conclusion of book one, I was over the moon to finally get Anna’s much wanted perspective. After all, the epitome of an anti-heroine, her viewpoint was the one piece of the puzzle that I had missed the last time around. Let me back up just a bit, though. I mean, this story had all of the winning attributes that I look for in a book. And the fact that it was yet another work of metafiction with book within a book additions? It just couldn’t have been better. Granted, it was somewhat of a long, slow burn until the last one hundred thrilling pages. A brilliantly combined mix of drama and suspense, the slow buildup nevertheless led to high stakes and a tense game of cat-and-mouse that won me over hook, line, and sinker by the perfectly plotted conclusion. As much as I loved this second book in the series, though, I do have to say that it didn’t quite blow me away as much as The Plot. That’s not to say that there weren’t plenty of twists that had my jaw on the floor here as well, because there unquestionably were. What was done better, however, was Anna. One truly villainous protagonist, her fully fleshed out persona and thorough background pulled me in deep. All told, I rallied behind her—despite (or because of) some truly despicable deeds. All in all, I was duly impressed. Original and yet oddly realistic, I never would have guessed where this one was heading. From the adrenaline-fueled climax to the well-written satire, my only hope is that there’s still room for a third book in the series. Perhaps The Epilogue would be fitting? After all, I would revel in another finely layered plot with more deftly obscured clues and morally gray characters. All I know is that this is not one to be missed. Just don’t go into it before first reading The Plot. In my estimation, that would be one doozy of a mistake. Rating of 4.5 stars.

82,5.0 out of 5 stars Can a sequel be better than the first book?,"The answer is a resounding, ‘YES!’ Picking up where “The Plot” left off, Ms. Korelitz weaves an even more fantastic tale with a contemptible, narcissistic anti-hero that I half-wanted to survive, but who I was also rooting to receive their just desserts!

87,5.0 out of 5 stars Book Review: Into the Uncut Grass by Trevor Noah,"You might think #trevornoah ‘s lane is the comedy club stage, but with Into the Uncut Grass, he’s stepped off the stage and into a world of quiet wonder. And surprisingly, it works. This book brought me right back to those days when I’d make friends with imaginary creatures and believe the backyard was a hidden jungle kingdom. It’s lighthearted yet somehow stirs up all those hidden depths—kind of like The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse, but with Trevor’s unique warmth splashed across every page. Reading it felt like finding an old map back to my imagination, the kind that had been tucked away for years. I couldn’t help but feel that familiar freedom—the kind that only comes when you’re young and limitless, when “pretend” isn’t just a game but an entire world of possibility. And just when you think you’re floating away on the nostalgia cloud, he brings in these lines that anchor you, like “If you still call it home, you can always go back.” A simple sentence, but somehow it gets you right in the heart. #IntotheUncutGrass is technically a picture book, but don’t let that fool you—it’s not just for kids. This one’s for kids to share with parents, parents to share with kids, and maybe even for grown-ups who need a break from “adulting.” It’s dedicated to the imagination that lives in all of us, waiting patiently for us to wander back and explore.

The story uses the journey, a gnome and some snails, to advise and illustrate how shifting one’s perspective is an important skill for learning and growing together. It fell short of one conversation for me. I wanted to see the boy return home and ask his mother why the rules had to be followed. I wanted to see him apply the skills he had observed on his journey. I wanted to see him work it out with her. I expected to see this, because of the way it was written. I loved the book, but this twinge of disappointment means I can not give it 5 stars. Trevor, I lived in South Africa from 1995-1999. I cried watching Invictus, because I marveled at a country who had transitioned from Apartheid with so much grace. Nelson Mandela was a beautiful person. My fifth son was born in South Africa. I wish you could come eat Indian food with us the next time you are in North Carolina. We love you.

98,5.0 out of 5 stars An emotional and fantastic book,"Phewwwwww. I am exhausted. That ending was - wow.  The ending just gutted me and also shocked me and I AM SO READY FOR THE NEXT ONE NOW PLEASE!! These characters were so good and complicated and the banter was perfection.  ST did an amazing job showing how easily desperation and horrible circumstances can turn someone into a person they nor you recognize. Are the characters irredeemable or is there hope?! You are on the edge of your seat trying to find out. I found the pacing to be a bit on the slower side at times so just be prepared, especially if you read the previous series and expect to jump bang into action. There is a lot of great world building; I love seeing and learning more about the different lands and cultures and magic. The writing was just as beautiful as expected and the imagery poignant the entire time. You CAN read this as a standalone series without reading the Ember series before, BUT I highly recommend you do because you emotional connection to this world and especially the previous trio of characters will be a huge factor in this story (IMHO).

This book is definitely another must read from an author who delivers timeless lessons, beautiful prose, and some dark twists that only hurt so badly because she makes us feel oh so much.

100,"4.0 out of 5 stars I didn't love it as much as Ember, but still amazing writing skill & thrilling fantasy novel","Ember in the Ashes is one of my favorite series and a series that I've read more than once. I was so excited to Heir and to be back in the same world but with new characters. I loved that we got to see some of our original characters and that their presence wasn't a minor easter egg but a presence as secondary characters. Quinn & Sorcha were my favorite POVs, whereas Aiz's plot line felt a little predictable. I quite enjoyed the story and all the characters, but this book lacked the wow factor that Ember in the Ashes brought to the table. I felt like the opening pacing was slow and this book took a little while to get going. The climax was glorious in the sense that Sabaa doesn't pull her punches when it comes to her characters, and there was a lot of brutality and death. I didn't quite love how this one ends in regards to the antagonist & where one of the characters leaves off at, but I will still read book 2 & anything else that Sabaa writes! She's a phenomenal author, and while I didn't love this book I feel like a 4-star rating is still earned!

101,5.0 out of 5 stars Sabaa out here causing more pain in the best way!!,"So. Many. Thoughts! First, Ilar! Uh I did not see that one coming and when I was hit upside the head with it I yelled, wait WHAT?! Twist of all twists. When I finished the Embers quartet I always say that Sabaa Tahir has zero respect for her characters. What do I mean by that? She likes to kill them off and hurt your feelings. That didn’t stop in Heir. I’d say don’t get overly attached to characters, but she makes it impossible not to. Just accept that you will be hurt and love the book all at once. Also understand she will give you trust issues, but you’ll always come back for more. The trust issues will make sense when you read this book. All that said, I highly recommend reading the Embers quartet before starting this because it will help in understanding some things. They’re also some of my favorite books ever and so worth the read. This book will be join them as an all time favorite as well. In this story you get to revisit some of the OG characters and see what they’ve become while meeting the next generation along with the others in this new crew. Ruh will steal your heart just so it can be shattered. Sirsha and Quil are the ones you will root for in every way. Sufiyan, Aurelia, and even Tas will bring the bit of comedic relief. Then Aiz, well you’ll have to determine your own feelings towards her. This book is the perfect example as to why too much power should never happen. How it corrupts and turns people away from the greater good and the goals they initially had, but also how the good can overpower it. If you want an action packed, murderous, romantasy that will make you cry this is the book for you. I know I say Sabaa gives me trust issues, but nobody brings pain more beautifully than her. If she writes it, I will always read it and recommend it!

103,5.0 out of 5 stars Return to the Empire!,"Aiz has burn scars from an orphanage fire ten years prior and wants vengeance for the victims of the fire. Prince Quil is heir after the Empress, his Aunt Helene, and he loves to be under the radar and roams the streets with anonymity. Bani al-Mauth, the holy figure Chosen of Death, meets with Quil after a homeless boy is killed by having his heart burned out of his chest. She wants Quil’s help in stopping the murders that have taken place. Sirsha is a poor jewel thief trying to survive the slums and earn enough to move away someday. She’s running from a violent gang and barely escapes when she’s found by a man who wants her help. Their paths will cross and danger follows. Likes/dislikes: It was nice to be in the world of An Ember in the Ashes again, over a decade into the future. Instead of learning about a new world and trying to navigate it, I was revisiting a world I was very familiar with. The new main characters are complex and each has a story to tell.

104,"5.0 out of 5 stars Like everything else, AI exists in context","Harari is an extremely lucid author who excels at distilling the complex into the simple. As in all his books, he seamlessly takes the reader from the distant past to the present to the future. In this case his subject is information and the networks we use to manage and disseminate it. As such it is, but isn’t, a book about AI. “My goal with this book is to provide a more accurate historical perspective on the AI revolution.” In many ways, it is a book about politics, although the author never names names or talks in terms of blue and red. And his canvas is global and spans history. He does, however, talk about democracy, populism, totalitarianism, and such, terms that are being bandied about a lot in the US this election year. And that, I suspect, is why the reviews of the book vary so widely. We are a polarized nation and want to inject politics into just about everything. Harari, however, is not a politician or political commentator. He is an historian who, of course, has not defined that history. His job is to spot the patterns. And in this case the pattern has a political implication.  “Democracy and dictatorship are typically discussed as contrasting political and ethical systems. This chapter seeks to shift the terms of the discussion, by surveying the history of democracy and dictatorship as contrasting types of information networks.” Which ultimately, of course, brings us to AI. The author correctly notes that AI is different from all prior information networks (e.g., printing, the telegraph, the Internet, the pre-modern church, etc.) in that it is the first network capable of acting independently of humans. And, as a result, it deserves special consideration, both for its opportunity and its menace. Adding a bit of gravity and urgency to the matter, Harari notes: “The main argument of this book is that humankind gains enormous power by building large networks of cooperation, but the way these networks are built predisposes us to use that power unwisely. Our problem, therefore, is a network problem.” Harari, among many other prominent voices, as a result, argues that we must manage the future application of AI. I agree. Our tech leaders, unfortunately, have shown themselves to be as independent of oversight as AI itself. And given the enormous amounts of capital that AI will undoubtedly unleash, my personal fear is that Silicon Valley, at Wall Street’s urging, will unleash AI before there is any public consensus on its application. After all, that is what they have done at every step of the digital revolution. They routinely release powerful new products that must almost immediately be updated to fix flaws and security oversights in their design. The earliest pioneers of the internet, as but one example, now readily admit that they did not foresee the degree to which it could be abused by malevolent actors. With AI, however, we may not get the chance to address the problems in retrospect. As part of its mission, the book also offers a plethora of insights into several important underlying currents of thought and conviction important to current culture. Some of my favorite quotes: “But power isn’t wisdom…” “The naïve view [of information] thinks that disagreements about values turn out on closer inspection to be the fault of either the lack of information or deliberate disinformation.” “History isn’t the study of the past; it is the study of change.” “However, democracy doesn’t mean majority rule; rather, it means freedom and equality for all.” “It is particularly crucial to remember that elections are not a method for discovering truth. Rather, they are a method for maintaining order by adjudicating between people’s conflicting desires.” “…information isn’t truth.” In the end, I believe it is an author’s job, with few exceptions, not to tell us what to believe, but to make us think. And with this book, in addition to his many others, this author has done just that. I do believe, therefore, that this book is worth every reader’s time. You won’t agree with everything he says. I didn’t, either. And it is true that the higher you take the camera the simpler the landscape looks, to the point of causing you to make erroneous conclusions about what you see. Not all patterns have meaning. Sometimes they are just patterns.

105,"5.0 out of 5 stars Information flow:  Its history, present & future uses and misuses by all not just a few","Entertaining and refreshingly  even sided coverage of the history, present and anticipated future uses and abuses of  information as a means to power, progress, or destruction  Harari besides thoughtfully brilliant and credible in its predictions/extrapolations for the future of information is courageous enough to be honest about the past and present of information control, albeit diplomatic with the status quo, of course, since he has ambitions to influence it. Harari doesn't shy away from a comprehensive review about who has been controlling information and who wants to controls Information versus those in favor of open information flows.  So when we first start reading ""Nexus"" we roll our eyes about he seemingly pointing only to the usual contemporary suspects on the right with the usual simplified rethoric about them, only to be regained to a balanced conversation  when he admits that controlling information as a means to power is much older and comes from the left and marxism. Hence, Instead of a fairy tale for children of good left guys and galls always accurate  and trustful and bad ones always lying that simpler less sophisticated minds in mainstream try to persuade us of, with Harari we get an adult centrist view and reflection about the nuances and both positive as well as negative view information on all sides  We leave the book much more educated and aware of all that surrounds us in terms of information networks and their potential for good and bad.  The same is true for Harari's view on Artificial Intelligence intertwined with information. Never childly, neither too optimistic nor too fearful he presents a realistic and credible view of how AI is going to occupy its space and mingle with us.  Great reading. Read more",15 Sep 2024,P.

106,4.0 out of 5 stars Definitely worth reading though not a good compass for navigating the future,"Nexus is the latest book by Yuval Noah Harari in which he explores some of the existential questions that concern technology and humanity and their interaction.  Starting from a perspective of information and its role in increasing participation or strengthening control the work weaves together a lot of topics to try to give a perspective on how technology is impacting society in some positive but many detrimental ways.  He then pursues the topic of AI which he alters the acronym to Alien intelligence to highlight the intrinsic difference in computational schemes that goes into machine technologies and highlights a multitude of scenarios that seem plausible but highly concerning about the embedding of more technology into our social structure.  It is a thought provoking book that highlights rational concerns on our future in a technology fueled world but it offers no real policy vision on what to do about it.  It does serve as a strong reminder that there are severe consequences to some of our technology roadmaps and they are already impacting us but again what to do about it is the real question not what are imaginable scenarios. The book is split into three parts starting with human networks.  The author in his usual style implicitly pokes fun at humanity's social structure and history of gravitating to mythology and shows how much of history has been about using information and story to create order.  Human stories create networks of common purpose far beyond the family unit and thus has been the basis of creating networks that allow for coordination on a scale that no other species can replicate.  This is a powerful concept introduced and is also then discussed in the context of democracy and autocracy.  The author highlights that the information structure of a democracy is that of greater participation in the information network and in autocracy it is a centralized one.  These different style focus on truth and order with different priorities.  The author brings up how in autocratic, mimicking religious frameworks the systems are built on the timelessness of the regime for providing solutions and thus infallibility is a pillar of the governance structures.  Democracy being an evolving system by construction is more fluid with the potential to get carried in different directions at different times.  The author makes it a strong point to highlight that democracy is not majoritarianism but is about the rights of citizens for themselves not the rights of citizens over others. The author moves onto computers and their influence.  He highlights the distributed nature of them as well as their permanence in the infrastructure we depend on.  The author starts to highlight how the control of this network has changed interaction structures as well as changed the likelihood of survival of autocratic regimes relative to the past.  In particular the information gathering networks of today can be processed in real time unlike in the past when piles of papers would be the product of surveillance that the state didn't have the capacity to process.  The author also highlights that networks can perpetuate bias and be error prone. From here the author moves on to the influence of technology on politics and its clear deterioration in recent times.  He gives a multitude of scenarios in which platforms with no editorial review that promote user engagement are mere platforms to perpetuate hate and sensationalism.  These examples all highlight how the ""objective function"" that many algorithms are trained to maximize have a negative relationship with human welfare.  There is also little consequence of this given the weak regulatory oversight.  Despite this problem the author is able to highlight that oversight itself solves little because we don't know the consequences of changing goals given the complexity of mapping the dynamics of the underlying ecosystem to their conclusions.  The author uses some examples where AI evades boundaries to achieve goals highlighting the increasing difficulty in constraining AI in practice.  Overall the book highlights the concerns many people have about the direction of technology and the speed at which technology has been disruptive.  Unfortunately despite such concerns resonating they do not offer sufficient concern to stop progress nor a blueprint for a dependable oversight structure, which is probably impossible to achieve anyway.  This leaves us unfortunately unsettled and without clear solutions. Nexus was a stronger work than Homo Deus and up there with Sapiens.  As usual he will likely have an audience which dislikes his style and willingness to poke fun at some of humanities mythologies but the content is deep and the argument construction is well thought out.  I definitely think this is a worthwhile read but be prepared to come out of it with no further wisdom on what to do about it. Read more",21 Oct 2024,A.

108,,"Yuri Noah Harari has to be one of the greatest story tellers today. I fell in love with his work Sapiens a few years ago as it opened my eyes to so much of human history that I was not aware of. A work I feel that should be taught in the school systems. This work, Nexus, is like that one only about the emergence of AI and how it has slowly evolved and continues to grow, becoming a part of society and the potential pluses and pitfalls that will come along with it. I, myself, am learning more and more about Artificial Intelligence and to be honest I would consider this a core work if you are looking to understand what A.I. is and where it could go. The depth of knowledge that the author consumed in writing this is staggering and his organization and referencing of those works is done masterfully. I was intrigued by just about everything in this work and here are some tidbits just minimally referenced: - Referring to the difference between Intelligence and Consciousness. An obvious comparison but I liked how he laid it out, I sort of gave it a variation though. He referred to an example of Intelligence as the means to be able to bring followers and subscribers to your channel to which I immediately thought, whereas conscience is how you feel about doing what was necessary to bring those followers to your channel. - The social credit system environment. He made a good point of if you have that in place in your society, say it was in the context of social credit for a religion. If someone gets max scores how do you know if the person did so because they truly believe in the religion or they just know how to play the game? - Finally, self-correction as what is needed to be in place to save us from A.I. getting away from humanity (my interpretation). Yes, for when there is no self-correction (as he brings up in the book) things can get away and go too far sometimes too quickly. Nexus is a true masterwork in my mind. I will read over and study this book. I have made note of many of the reference books and plan to get/read a number of them as well. More than 5 stars.

115,5.0 out of 5 stars Simply A Wonderful Novel.,"This really is an exceptional book,  but it took 50 pages or so for the author to lay the foundation w/ all- new characters,  in an entirely new line of books! One of the most important things to know about this novel is that Mr Osman did not use nearly as much humor to tell this story as he did w/ the Thursday Murder Club! Don't get me wrong, I loved nearly every one of his previous novels he wrote,  but I could have done without some of the hilarity that he used in those novels! But in my opinion he did not make that same mistake in this latest book, which is titled We Solve Murders! We Solve Murders was a much more serious- minded book,  and he used a much more serious level of dialog! And as far as I'm concerned, Osman hit it out of the park w/ this book! It was absolutely wonderful! The characters were all great, and the storyline was absolutely amazing! The pages literally flew by and the book was finished in no time!

129,4.0 out of 5 stars Estranged siblings seek to solve the mystery of their father's death.,"I enjoyed this mystery about the death of Liam Samuel Noone, the thrice-married father of three, and developer and head “of the most sought-after luxury boutique hotel and resort empire in North America.” What caused him to fall to his death from the cliff just outside his seaside cottage in central California? Accident? Self-harm? Something more nefarious? Did it involve the family's resort business? A competitor? An enemy he might have made? Those are among the questions two of his adult children, Sam and Nora, set out together to answer. Never mind that they grew up in separate households and have spent no time together; or that Nora—who’s already succeeded as a “neuroarchitect,” designing spaces to benefit health and well-being—wants nothing to do with Sam, the company her father built, or any of her father’s wealth. What they share is the desire for answers. It's a well-written book. There's plenty of conflict. The characters have depth. Their relationships, and the family dynamics and dysfunction, are compelling. Author Laura Dave thoroughly explores themes of loss, grief, aloneness, and what it means to be left ""orphaned,"" even as an adult. The New York and California settings are well-described, giving us clear pictures of where we are and helping to involve us in the story. And there's more than one twist to the tale. Protagonist, Nora, does engage in lots of internal ruminating about her losses and feelings. Sometimes it adds to the story. Sometimes it drags at it or gets in the way.

130,5.0 out of 5 stars A TWISTY TALE...,"In this riveting novel from the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Last Thing He Told Me, estranged siblings discover their father has been keeping a secret for over fifty years, one that may have been fatal… Liam Noone was many things to many people. To the public, he was an exacting, self-made hotel magnate fleeing his past. To his three ex-wives, he was a loving albeit distant family man who kept his finances flush and his families carefully separated. To Nora, he was a father who often loved her from afar – notably a cliffside cottage perched on the California coast from which he fell to his death. The authorities rule the death accidental, but Nora and her estranged brother Sam have other ideas. As Nora and Sam form an uneasy alliance to unravel the mystery, they start putting together the pieces of their father’s past—and uncover a family secret that changes everything. My Thoughts: As I buried myself in the secrets and mysteries of The Night We Lost Him, I was captivated.  And intrigued. A family surrounded by mysterious connections and lost moments finds its way in the days following the death of the patriarch.  What was going on in his life just before his death, and what answers can they discover? Nora was the primary narrator, and I felt a connection to her as she took the reader along on her journey. What would happen next? How would she find out what had been missing in her life? An unbelievable story that earned 5 stars.

133,5.0 out of 5 stars Book of the year,"OK, I’m going to flat out say it: “Creation Lake” is a masterpiece, and I hope it sweeps the awards (National Book, Pulitzer, Booker) for 2024. But let me clarify one thing for my readers: this is not a conventional spy story; it is, despite what the blurbs would try to tell you, not a page turner; it is not a beach read. It’s an extended essay as much as it’s a novel. And it will inject itself in your mind if you let it. It is a complicated swirl of social satire snaking around an agent known here only as Sadie (she tells the tale in the first person), who’s assigned to get the goods on a commune in rural France (Kushner seems to know the area well) and deliver information to her boss(es), who are, with the aid of the French government, eager to seize the land in order to develop it. Something like that. As she insinuates herself into the group Sadie’s whirlaround first-person narration takes you back to an earlier operation, which didn’t go as planned, and provides you with information about, among other things, the Neanderthals. Read it with Wikipedia at hand. Kushner populates the book with a sack full of interesting characters (at least characters of interest to the author), the primary one perhaps being the semi-elusive Bruno, who lives in a cave, emerging from time to time to email his fans about life in the Pleistocene. Interesting they may be, but whether Kushner means them to be loved or laughed at is something for her readers to decide, although in its mocking final pages, the author does seem to make her own point of view more clear. Regardless it will fascinate and thought-provoke. Notes and Asides: If you liked Eleanor Catton’s “Birnam Wood” you will probably like this.

134,4.0 out of 5 stars Not My Favorite,"This book got a lot of good reviews and has been high up on the bestseller list, so I guess I just didn't get it.  I normally like spy novels, but this one was not entertaining to me.  I read about 250 pages of it and quit, and maybe if I had kept going, all would have become clear in the end, but I do not have the patience.  I had a hard time keeping track of the various characters and their purposes.  It didn't help that the main character became someone's mistress in order to spy on him, but I also was not ever sure exactly why she was spying.  So this was not one of my favorite books.  (Sorry.)

135,3.0 out of 5 stars A Woman without. Soul Finds Redemption in a Mercedes,"Rachel Kushner’s main character, Sadie Smith, is a 34-year-old freelance spy. She is, in essence, a professional betrayer. She is good at her job. She has no certain past, and comes from no certain time or place. She has a predilection for history and philosophy but no declared ideology. Her metaphor for stalwart activities is “salt,” or grit, her essence. Her mentor of sorts lives in a cave to study Neanderthals, a somewhat extreme metaphor for retreat from modernity. Author Rachel Kushner has said that, “I am suspicious of character. I fear indivisible, ideological underpinnings.” She claims that her characters are less like a voice, more like a thought. This reader agrees with her characterization here, but it hampers her narrative. Her main character’s role is to witness and report. Restating Kushner’s own words, her characters exist to register experience and contradiction, a disenfranchised espionage, so to speak. Sadie Smith is not her real name (we never learn it); she comes from a place with no population, and none of her relationships are honest. She is a cynic, and essentially a nihilist (an ideology, by the way). Le Moulin, is a utopian commune in rural France, her assignment is to expose and destroy. The commune was conceived by her titular mentor, Bruno (whose email she’s hacked), and administered by a man named Pascal, accused by some who know him as a manipulating egotist. Both men are 1960s vintage French utopians (read emotionally stunted control freaks). Both were anti-establishmentarians of their day, and the remote commune is a remnant of a mostly failed social rebellion and experiment. Kushner writes of Sadie’s problematic understanding: “In my own salt, my own core, this is what I knew: Life goes on a while, then it ends. There is no fairness. Bad people are honored and good ones are punished…But deep down, even if they lack the courage to admit it, they know that the world is lawless, chaotic, and random.” A professional betrayer of this stripe must finally therefore be a nihilist. Crucially, is the novel, Creation Lake, a success, a failure, or something in between? Or is something missing from the mix? This is a legitimate question for a reader to continuously ask until the last line of the narrative. Well? Rachel Kushner is a smart, crisp writer of prose. Until the last one hundred pages there is perhaps more telling of story than showing of character. Fiction writers are admonished to avoid this mostly, but not always, as a grievous fault. Rachel Kushner’s good writing hand conceals a multitude of sins, but these sins are volitional and can be disguised as virtues. The result is mixed. For example, not really enjoying on-the-job sex might be considered honest, until deeper reflection exposes the cold treachery of an emotionally unreachable, toxic cynic. We learn she has been fired from the FBI after a prosecution of a young man she seduced with romantic falsehoods to commit crimes gets an unforeseen and undesired light sentence. As a default, Sadie Smith freelances in industrial espionage for a vaguely reactionary capitalist entity seeking information against agricultural purists. Her employers are never identified beyond this, and when she negotiates a high price for the killing of a French Bureaucrat, after fleeing the scene of her grim doing, Sadie Smith begins to seek meaning and purpose, using the metaphor of Polaris, given to her by cave-dweller Bruno. A final comment is to note the high praise given on the cover: “thrilling, electrifying, piercingly moral, primal, pure, and unforgettable.” Rachel Kushner, we are told, is a Booker Prize finalist, a two-time National Book Award finalist, and one of the most gifted authors of her generation. Is this a writer for the 21st century? Curious readers might want to find out for themselves. Tom Casey Read more",29 Oct 2024,T. P.

136,5.0 out of 5 stars Don’t be fooled by the hype,"Yes, our main character, Sadie is an agent, a spy, sent to the western coast of France to infiltrate a leftist environmental collective in order to trigger illegal activity that could conceivably dissolve the collective and their mission: to live off the land and protest governmental and corporate co-opting of the land and water for their purposes. All of the things we have come to expect from spy thrillers are reduced and very unromantic. Instead, we are introduced to the scholarly writing of the group’s mentor, Bruno, who sends regular emails containing his musings on Neanderthals, and later on the Polynesian tribes who could navigate using the stars in ways modern man cannot understand. We get to know Sadie and the collective. Sadie’s real self gradually emerges through her immersion in Bruno’s pondering, and her contact with the people and place. The mission is just another frame up, an elaborate kind of entrapment. What makes this novel a great success for me is Sadie’s voice, wit, and insight. She’s begins her mission as a jaded traveler, and ends in her own skin. I loved this book.

138,,"The lead character of Rachel Kushner’s novel ‘Creation Lake’ has a fake name (Sadie Smith), fake breasts and fake beliefs. She’s a spy, in the sense that her job is to infiltrate a left wing, back-to-the-earth group, known as Le Moulin and find out if they are responsible for sabotage against large agribusiness, but Sadie is as much agent provocateur as she is spy because while Sadie pretends to espouse back-to-the-earth beliefs what she really believes in is earning as much money as she can. For Sadie, how much she is paid, has a lot to do with her self-worth, or does it? It sometimes seems that Sadie isn’t real but more a literary creation for Kushner to play with ideas about how difficult it is for humans to have unalloyed beliefs and intentions. Sadie is like the character Malvo in the first instalment of Noah Hawley’s TV anthology series ‘Fargo’ where you wonder whether the character is real or more a personification of evil and as Sadie says about her fake breasts (which she tells us don’t need a bra) ‘does it matter?’ It depends, perhaps, on whether truth matters. Kushner, the author, is asking whose truth? Sometimes in reading ‘Creation Lake’ I felt I had slipped into a literary hole where today’s leading authors play with each other’s themes and one novel slides into another of another writer. We begin with and old leftie called Bruno holding forth about Neanderthals. Sadie is clandestinely reading Bruno’s emails in which Bruno claims, much like the science fiction writer Robert Sawyer, that Neanderthals were altogether better than us. What is this major digression for? Well, first, it is entertaining and second Bruno feels strangely innocent in a way that Pascal an the leaders of Le Moulin do not. Bruno’s Neanderthals have the perfection of Man before the Fall. Bruno wants to return to Eden and at their best that’s what the members of Le Moulin are trying to do too but just as Bruno’s meanderings are a little cracked so the egalitarian ideology of Le Moulin is cracked too. Women are subservient at Le Moulin and the local farmers they are busy supporting are bigots. We are in France but it feels more like a primordial soup of ideas where hypocrisy is the biggest idea of all and Sadie, who, in many ways is a thoroughly unpleasant person comes cross as more real and more grounded than the agitators she has infiltrated. She also feels like a literary artifact who could as easily exist in a Jennifer Egan novel as in Kushner’s. This is hardly by accident. Sadie steals like the Sasha character in ‘A Visit from the Good Squad’ steals and as the ‘Goon Squad’, in part, is about the uncertainty of time so Sadie says ‘in order to locate the precise moment you can take unseen, you slow it all down. You make time stop.’ Both Sadie and Sasha steal because it makes them feel more alive and both undergo transformations that feel like wish fulfillment as if people are infinitely malleable and can be different at different times and in different  circumstances. It feels as if there are themes buzzing across the Zeitgeist. There’s an air of menace in ‘Creation Lake’ that helps drive the narrative as Sadie works to provoke Le Moulin into a big act of sabotage and maybe murder. It keeps you reading as you wonder whether Sadie will succeed and if she does whether she will escape. Whatever else the novel is doing it is also telling a spy story much in the way Le Carre tells spy stories. You want to know what happens. Sadie is a private spy working for unnamed shadowy bosses because the FBI fired her for entrapment. Provocation is her skill set. Agribusiness it seems, has fewer scruples than American law enforcement. And then, the whole protest movement of Le Moulin (rather obviously ‘the mill’ in English) feels much like the Massive Brigade in Olen Steinhauer’s ‘The Middle man’ but with more literary pretensions. Here are protest movements that like the ‘Occupy’ movement are more about protest than getting anything done. That very current word ‘performative’ comes to mind. But Sadie is not performative. She does get stuff done, even if sometimes, by accident. She uses sex as a tool of infiltration - she doesn’t like it much but even that is debatable because little Sadie says or does can be trusted. She’s a piece of work and yet a peculiarly current one. If ideals have become misplaced and truth is a moving target then Sadie is a heroine for our times. Maybe there will be book two. If there is, I’ll read it.

141,,"brilliant, funny and mysterious thriller, with echoes of Naipaul's Guerrillas I bought this Booker-longlisted book because a review mentioned it had something to do with Neanderthals, a science interest of mine. I had been on a medieval historians' trip to Cathar country but to my shame had never heard of the Cagots, so that aspect was very interesting. The only caveat in a thrilling read was that the heroine's employers were not fleshed out enough at the end to provide firm motivation, as she is not really motivated by money. The guru's story was beautifully woven in.

142,,"Book : Creation Lake Author: Rachel Kushner Creation lake is among the 13 books long listed for the Booker Prize this year. The Mars Room written by the author was previously shortlisted for the year 2018 . The book is a mystery thriller involving a private spy going by the Pseudonym Sadie Smith, who is assigned by unnamed Capitalists to spy on the group of eco activists from Le Moulin in the outskirts of France and to neutralize them. They were suspected to have wreaked havoc on a megabasin project which involves outsourcing water from local water bodies favoring a Corporate project. She enters among them in the guise of the wife of friend of one of the chief activists Pascal Balmy. In the meantime she is enticed by the ideologies of their mentor , Bruno Lacombe who communicates to the group only through mail which she intercepts regularly. The major part of the book is filled with details about the Neanderthals who are referred to as Thals by Bruno and the story is spinned on its spine and extends to astronomy, Nature, philosophy and what not ! He despises civilization,lives in a cave and hopes a close knit community of people far away from technology is the solution and romanticizes the idea of a prehistoric life. The last few pages are a real page turner in contrast to the snail paced narration from the beginning. The story ends with answering the question of whether she succeeded in her mission or not. Sadie’s character evolution is remarkable and so is her spying skills and we all do wish to meet Bruno, just like her !! The many backstories for all the characters feels a bit dragging and too much information about the Thals makes us search for the story amongst the endless rants. So,this one is not a book for someone who finds history boring . But definitely an interesting read in my opinion and feels like a patchwork quilt of so many topics tried to convey at a single go !

I read a lot and I have a love for writers so you could say I have broad interests and forgive occasional problems with novels like grammar and structure etc.  This novel is however perfect.  It's a murder mystery and a love story.  Both literary and accessible. The final lessons are extraordinary.  Only a writer of fine gifts could create this.

145,"5.0 out of 5 stars If you love character-driven novels that focus on conversation, this is the perfect book","Elizabeth Strout has the unique ability to make the ordinary seem extraordinary. The characters she has created over the years are probably stereotypes in some sense since they represent typical people in a small town in Maine—a minister, lawyer, writer, police chief, schoolteacher, and others. However, the introspective conversations she creates among her characters are amazingly representative of every human being and are relatable on multiple levels. I've read almost all of Strout's books, and along with a few other authors, I feel as though I have lived my adult life and grown through some of the perspectives of Olive Kitteridge, Lucy Barton, and the Burgess men. These familiar characters all appear in Tell Me Everything. Since they are all aging, the issues of dealing with adult children, failing health, and loneliness are addressed with poise, humor, and dignity. A central theme in this novel is ""unrecorded lives."" In her nineties, Olive Kitteridge wishes to tell stories about people to Lucy Barton, a writer. Lucy listens to her stories and relays a few of her own. As they ponder the meaning of the stories, it becomes apparent that all lives are noteworthy and chance encounters with unknown people can be significant. Storytelling, so much a part of our culture, is exalted in this novel, and those who can listen and learn from others' stories are the most likable characters. In conversations Attorney Bob Burgess has with his brother Jim, his wife Margaret, his ex-wife Pam, his client Matt, and his friend, Lucy Barton, the reader gains tremendous insight into various personalities and human needs. There is a detailed discussion about narcissism, gaslighters, and other character traits which cause consternation. In addition, some relationships include linchpins and cycles of abuse. There are discussions of alcoholism, suicide, patricide, and matricide. Strout's expressions when giving her characters words exemplify her understanding of the human condition. I loved when someone was referred to as a sin eater—they ""eat"" other people's sins and make themselves miserable. There are numerous depictions of ""broken"" people, those who need a good hug and those who just need to be heard. So much of real life is conveyed in Strout's fictional yet realistic characters.

146,5.0 out of 5 stars Feels like the last season of a great TV show,Elizabeth Strout brings her best known and loved characters together in what I assume is one last hurrah.  Olive is now 90.  Bob Burgess and  Lucy Barton are in the 60's.  It's post pandemic Maine.  As I have read all her previous novels this book feels like that last season of a loved tv show.  It doesn't disappoint and is quite satisfying.  Strout doesn't shy away from the challenges of modern life nor is she overly romantic.  There is nostalgia for those who've read the previous works and new engaging plot lines and wonderful dialogue..  I had a kind've a wistful yearning when perhaps we are all younger and yet all these characters are so alive and LIVING.  It's wonderful story.  Her style of writing is completely her own but not redundant.  Just lovely.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.

147,3.0 out of 5 stars The Olive Moments Were Good,"Olive Kitteridge and Olive Again are two of my favorite contemporary novels of all time, so I was really looking forward to this book. The Olive moments didn't disappoint - she's just as salty and inwardly caring as always. The character is Lucy is well-drawn as well - she's dreamy and full of love of all people and the world, yet prickly when poked. I also liked the character of Bob, whose thoughts on his bad haircut reminded me of the sweetly humorous insightful character studies of Anne Tyler. However, the story, unlike the stories within the story, dragged along for some reason. It was difficult to care about the woman who got murdered or the back story of her family, for some reason. I know that the story needed some sort of plot, but I'm not sure a murder mystery was a good fit to the character development within the story. I kept skipping ahead to the places where Olive and Lucy meet up and had hoped that there was more here. I also wished to know more about Margaret and Bob's relationship and Margaret herself, how she became a pastor, for example. This book will still find its place on my shelf with the Olive books, but it was not as satisfying of a read by a long shot.

148,5.0 out of 5 stars A Real Sleeper!,"There was so much to love about this book…I felt validated in so many different ways. I found the first few pages hum -drum and wondered why it had won a Pulitzer Prize..but that feeling soon evaporated. The character analyses were stellar…especially the three main characters: Bob, Lucy and Olive. The subtle wisdom impacted in this book is priceless. Relationships are complicated..all relationships have so many twists and turns. I especially loved how the author handled the dialogue and the personal worries/ thoughts each character emoted. The simplicity of the dialogue betrayed the sophistication contained therein. One last observation that pervades this novel: Our childhood experiences resonate in us forever and shape what we think of ourselves …and how we see the world The Biology of Belief and Determined are two books that I would recommend in order to understand ourselves and this novel.

151,,"The fifth book in Strout's Amgash series, Lucy is now settled in Maine and we also see her interactions with characters featured in more detail in her other books. Lucy and Olive Kitteridge form a friendship telling each other stories. But Bob Burgess who also featured in The Burgess Boys is the main focus of this novel. I adore the way Strout can tell such a rich and beautiful story. I loved the relationship between these characters, especially Lucy and Bob's friendship. Bob is the lawyer to an oddball man, Matthew whose mother is found dead, and the way he cares for him throughout the whole book is touching. Five stars from me.

156,5.0 out of 5 stars Magic and Adventure,"This was such a fun book, I was hooked from the very beginning. Leopold is a great character to follow and I loved the adventure and magic we get to experience alongside him. It was touching and emotional seeing 17 year old Leopold still struggle with his mom’s passing five years on. His father’s blunt disapproval is slowly draining Leopold and it was tough to watch. Richter Berry can shove it to be honest! The magic and world building had me believing I was in the book and reminded me of my favorite adventure movies growing up. Such a cool concept and executed wonderfully. The mystery and clues left by Larry’s mom added an exciting layer to discover and I really loved the connection he had with his mom. Needless to say, I ate up the short action packed chapters and am dying to read the next installment.

160,3.0 out of 5 stars Fans of Harry Potter will see similarities in Ransom Riggs’ (Leopold Berry) Sunderworld novel.,"The novel begins fairly well, but soon there are awkward and unnecessary adjectives that probably were added by an editor who attended a boarding school in England. They became annoying and impediments to the narrative. All could have been left out. The rule I have, as a writer, is if a word is not poetically satisfying then why add it? No one, and very few YA readers, speak this way. By page forty-one, the protagonist, Leopold (Larry) Berry, realizes his overacting imagination may be real, and Sunder is an actual place, not an imaginary world he’d escaped to via his (deceased) mother’s VHS tapes. His father is a stereotypical angry white man with unreasonably high  expectations for seventeen year old Leopold.  The focus is on Leopold’s relationship with his childhood friend, Emmet, a smart, sometimes  annoying, black kid. The novel turns entirely Harry Potter by Chapter 13, when the boys board a defunct trolley, and use a coin Leopold has obtained from an animatronic raccoon in the upstairs of a crummy Los Angeles restaurant named Clifton’s. The trolley takes them to a dirty, dangerous Sunder Hill, a seemingly parallel world in L.A. where weird magic is normal. At this juncture I began to lose interest in the novel. It had crossed into the trope of magic as a device to fill out the deficits of plot. Why not keep the story in the real Los Angeles, where there is no shortage of strange places and characters? Why not let Leopold go by his more interesting given name, instead of downgrading him to Larry?  Leopold should work out his estrangement from reality in the real world without the convenient device of magic that is so popular in what I describe as cheap literature. But having said that, aficionados and devotees of Harry Potter style works will get their cheap thrill from this novel. I hated the out of place adjectives, which to me clued me early on that this novel was cranked out in the formulaic style I disdain. Nowhere near as original as The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon.

166,3.0 out of 5 stars It’s ok.,I’m not seeing the hype here. I couldn’t find myself caring about really any of the characters and felt the author spent wayyy too much time describing their surroundings and inconsequential aspects instead of focusing on more important details. Details and explanations that could’ve helped me relate to the characters better. You are made to think their mother is the literal worst but she is not portrayed that way when we finally get to see interaction with her. 3 out of the 4 sisters are/were addicts and none of them recognized this in the other? Too unrealistic for sisters with such a close bond. I do love the focus on the special relationship between sisters and I actually enjoyed the last quarter of the book and the ending. It wrapped up nicely but was overall too chaotic and the storylines too all over the place. Edited to add: I think I maybe am being a little too critical of this book but I feel it’s because I had such big expectations that it just didn’t meet.

167,5.0 out of 5 stars Beautifully devastating,"This was a beautifully devastating story of true sisterhood and navigating grief when one does not even know how to process it.  This novel touches on so many heavy topics in a way that makes it feel like a light read. I devoured this novel in less than a day. I was up on a work night trying to finish it up and was crying at work reading the conclusion. Brutally honest description of the relationship between sisters and the shared trauma that impacted them differently. I resonated so much with each of the sisters but truly felt stripped bare in my connection with Avery. As an eldest sister I have always felt the implied/assigned role of taking care of my youngest sisters. The burden that could be real or not sometimes cripples us in our life and is a constant push to do more since we never do enough. Each sister's guilt was palpable throughout the story and their yearning to have done differently and changed the outcomes of their sister's ultimate demise. Accepting that they each have their faults and learning to accept them and do better was incredible to read. I was especially glad to see how messy it all got and not everything immediately had a clean end. BUT THE EPILOGUE made the ending so perfect. This has easily joined the top of my ranks for my favorite books. I am excited to constantly visit these characters and their lives. Thank you to Ballantine Books, NetGalley, and Coco Mellors for allowing me the extreme honor of an ARC of this book and allowing me to process it before I was able to buy the book for my own and relive it.

168,4.0 out of 5 stars Better than I expected,"I ordered this because of the ""Jenna"" recommendation.  I have liked most of the books she puts her name on.  When this started out, I figured it was going to be another of those ""dysfunctional family"" books, and in some ways it is that, but at least the characters are entertaining and interesting, so it reads fairly quickly.  The story is told in alternating chapters for each sister.  Each one has problems of one kind or another, and while they want to get along with each other, they don't always.  However, they seem to have good hearts, and the story ends well, so I am glad I read it.

Avery, Bonnie & Lucky are grieving the loss of their sister Nicky who passed away at the age of 27 due to an overdose. Addiction has deep roots in the Blue family as their father is an alcoholic, Avery a recovering addict and Lucky an addict in denial. The grief eats away at each of the girls in different ways and as they rebuild their relationships with one another through the shared pain, they begin to heal. This story shows some of the darkest parts of addiction, I was scared for Lucky as she spiraled. There were instances where I found Avery to be so cringey, angry and cruel. Bonnie, although struggling, was the light this book needed. She balanced everything out and her individual story was by far my favorite of the girls.

180,5.0 out of 5 stars I really loved this sweet little book!,"A short book, translated from Japanese as a series of connected small tales of a mysterious clinic in a dark alley of Kyoto. The clinic prescribes cats for various conditions. Leaving the clinic with a cat carrier and cat necessities, the characters describe how things change for them before they return the cat to the clinic with a new perspective on their lives. Great cats (and people). Some may find the translations a bit minimal, but for me the quiet simple text brought stronger emotions than many complicated stories written in English. A fun book.

189,,"Another Japanese best seller and rightly so. This novel is entertaining and also teaches something about ourselves (or it did to me). It is a ""quiet"" reading into the lives of ordinary people confronted by mental health issues usually brought on by work/office stress - so to me highly relatable. The way these people overcome their stresses is admirable and sometimes the only way to overcome the problems is to leave problem places and problem people. Yes, it is fearful to do so, but having a therapy cat goes a long way to help you. It is the way these people come to their decisions that is the most interesting thing - their motivations, their care, their fulfilment. I love the ideas in this book and the way it concerns the lives of ordinary people. I am someone who is extremely ordinary and as such I like to read about ordinary people overcoming problems and learning how they did. They make you feel a part of something more out there and that you are not alone in a stressful workplace with untenable colleagues. The novel is involving and hard to put down, and the characters resonate. Thank you to the author for an excellent novel.

190,5.0 out of 5 stars Smart and Fun,"The Wedding People starts off like your typical rom-com—wedding chaos, quirky characters, plenty of humor—but don’t be fooled. It quickly dives into darker territory, using weddings as a backdrop to explore broken relationships, family dysfunction, and all the messiness that comes with them. The humor stays, but it’s sharper, more nuanced, and set alongside the serious moments. The characters are flawed in a way that feels refreshing and realistic. You’ll be shaking your head at decisions one minute and rooting for them the next. It’s more about self-discovery than happily-ever-after, and that’s what makes it so different and engaging. Espach’s writing really steals the show. Her sharp, witty prose elevates even the mundane moments, and when the story gets darker, her clever observations keep you hooked. If you want a rom-com with more bite and depth, this is a smart, satisfying read.

192,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Book Ever,"I had preordered this book from a recommendation in a magazine. When it came I immediately started to read- and never put it down until I finished. It was fascinating and probably not only one of the best story lines but some of the best writing by an author EVER. I read it with a highlighter because there were so many good phrases and sentences to remember. I then passed it on to my daughter and she loved it so much that her book club is going to read it next month when it is her turn to pick the book.  It was by far one of the best books I have ever read.  I will say that the main character is one that almost anyone can identify with, and the bride was delightful and one could not help but fall in love with her and her enthusiasm for everything she did. Ans that’s all I’ll give away about the plot. This book was unforgettable. I highly recommend.

194,4.0 out of 5 stars This book opens up dialogue to be true to you,"An insightful book that delves into the topics of relationships, loss, and a lesser story on weddings. It's really a book about the choices we make. There is meaning behind the plot: we can be our authentic selves and make different choices. Ones that makes us feel more alive, more happy, more ourselves. The beginning is depressing but keep going because it does get better, just like real life. The characters all have flaws, but that's what makes you want to like them. And you do because the good and bad characteristics are what makes them seem real. On page 313, ""...for the rest of your life, [you] would have to keep 'checking in.' Look in the mirror and repeatedly ask herself [yourself], Am I being honest right now?"" That's what we have to do single every day. Check in with our feelings and be honest with ourselves about our wants, hopes, dreams. It all starts with being open of doing the work to learn about you, then going after what you want. And not worrying about what others will think. Sometimes easier said than done, I know. We all get caught up in pretending to be what we think someone else wants us to be. But we get this so wrong.  What we think others want from us is not usually correct and we lose ourselves in the process. We become confined and chains to this persona and this makes us unhappy. If anything, this book opens up conversation to be true to yourself. And that my friends is a lovely gift. :) Read more",11 Oct 2024,Lynn Lok-Payne,4.0,B0CJ839C56,"https://www.amazon.com/Wedding-People-Novel-Alison-Espach-ebook/dp/B0CJ839C56/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

There are so many sensible pieces of advice for women in this story but they're part of Phoebe's journey so the author doesn't sound like she's trying to teach us something. But she IS teaching us how to stand up for ourselves and to love ourselves and what we want in life and out of life.  Beautiful story and wonderful characters.

203,5.0 out of 5 stars Haunting story of the US criminal justice system,"I want to start off with this book is dense, it’s written so well, but at the same time, it really feels like a non-fiction book meant to teach you something. It’s the kind of book you read and digest every word and that takes time. So I read it slow, 50 pages a day, until I realized I had to sit down and read this book until I finish because it was making me hate any other book I touched in the meantime. As a former law student, who wanted to become a public defender, and got offered the job, but turned it down, this book was exactly what I needed. It haunted every thought while I was working, reading any other book, driving, basically if I could have been reading instead it’s what I wanted to do. This book so into such depth of criminal procedure, the issues with all sides, and the cases and precedence that got our criminal justice system to the point it is. You’ll learn so much about criminal trial procedure, criminal investigations, appeals, and the development of the innocence project and DNA testing. It brings everything together so well in each part of the book that it feels like you are there, and you’ll remember all the little details as the story goes on!

204,5.0 out of 5 stars A Must Read - possibly the most impactful book of our time,"There's a lot wrong with our justice system.  If you've ever wondered if there is merit to all the claims or exactly how it works, read this book. Better yet, let the author read it to you on Audible. In the post-George Floyd era this is possibly the most impactful book you could read. Ms. Hagerty delivers research, stories, and a wealth of information in a compelling way that draws the reader in. I could not put it down. Ben's story is fraught with injustice, and there are so many more stories here.

213,"4.0 out of 5 stars Sweeping, searing treatment of the history of Mesopotamia","“The woman was puzzled and saddened when she learned that people over there filled a bathtub with water and then sat in it to soap themselves. She could not believe that anyone would be senseless enough to plunge into clean water without having first washed themselves.” (p181) I enjoy stories that involve several intersecting storylines across multiple timelines. When done well, they can be quite moving. This one’s done well. Water is a pervasive, unifying theme; in fact, a single drop of water plays a significant metaphorical role in the story. Fair enough – I see and appreciate that. But I would describe the tale as a sweeping, searing account of the history of Mesopotamia, and the clash of cultures that informs that history. There are plenty of moments of hope and beauty, but this isn’t a story in which everything works out in the end. You don’t need to know the Epic of Gilgamesh to follow this story, but it helps to have a general idea of its history and content. So before reading this book, you might want to read an overview like the Wikipedia article on the topic.

The book begins with King Ashurbanipal of Mesopotamia  before the common era.  There are two main threads that weave through these characters stories; the poem Gilgamesh and water.  This exceptional historical fiction has taught me about worlds I can barely image; extreme poverty in the Victorian age, horrific treatment of a minority in the Middle East and antiquities.  The book ask big questions about who has the right to house and care for a culture’s antiquities among others that would include spoilers.

216,5.0 out of 5 stars I am so glad I found this author! She deserves awards!,"A while back I stumbled onto the book ""The Architect's Apprentice""  and loved it. I read a lot of literature  books, and when I come across a author I like to read all their books. I jumped ahead to this book just so I could give her a great review.  Her stories seem well researched, and I guess you could say she writes historical fiction, but whenever I see a book labeled historical fiction I first think that it might be boring.  Not so with this author, her stories are fascinating and her characters are ones you get to know very well. This new book is excellent and I now want to read ""The epic of Gilgamesh"".  She brings such clarity to history, religious strife and conflicts, of which I know a lot about by reading about 100 novels from India and middle East. Casual reader do not be afraid, Its such a great read, plus I learned a lot also.

221,,"""Water remembers. It is humans who forget."" Even a single raindrop. Thus begins the master storyteller, Elif Shafak's , ""There are Rivers in the Sky"". When one writes about history, it's a narration of what has been told many times over. The approach of a writer, is what, sets it apart. Here, Elif deploys the journey of a drop of water, to illustrate the times, from the ancient ruins of Nineveh in Mesopotamia to the birth and life of Arthur in Victorian London, to Narin of the Yezdi community, by the river Tigris in Turkey, to Zaleekhah, a hydrologist in London, in 2018. The extensively researched account of each period is an attention holder. The Epic of Gilgamesh, an iconic poem in the Cuneiform script holds centrestage. Woven around them are stories of antiquities, mysticism, cultural appropriation, war, immigration, race conflicts and genocide. Elif Shafak holds one spellbound with her expertise - interspersed are lyrical quotes and elaborate, vivid descriptions of the prevailing atmosphere and settings. A departure from her previous books, this acclaimed top lister, reinforces her stature as a commanding writer. A life philosophy embedded, in her lines from the book - ""Go like water, come back like water-freely and easily."" Highly recommended.

225,4.0 out of 5 stars Solid Mystery !,"‘24 - 4 STARS DESCRIPTION : On the outside they were the golden family with the perfect life. On the inside they built the perfect lie. A young nanny who plunged to her death, or was she pushed? A nine-year-old girl who collects sharp objects and refuses to speak. A lawyer whose job it is to uncover who in the family is a victim and who is a murderer. But how can you find out the truth when everyone here is lying? Rose Barclay is a nine-year-old girl who witnessed the possible murder of her nanny - in the midst of her parent's bitter divorce - and immediately stopped speaking. Stella Hudson is a best interest attorney, appointed to serve as counsel for children in custody cases. She never accepts clients under thirteen due to her own traumatic childhood, but Stella's mentor, a revered judge, believes Stella is the only one who can help. REVIEW : Previous book by Sarah Pekkanen “alone” was Gone Tonight (‘23 - 5 Stars). Previous books by this author co-authored with Greer Hendricks, were The Golden Couple (‘22 - 4 Stars), You Are Not Alone (‘20 - 5 stars), An Anonymous Girl (‘19 - 4 Stars) and The Wife Between Us (‘18 - 3 Stars). Earned Double Kindle Rewards with this purchase. Great writing like always which kept me intrigued. A twisted legal case to find a nanny’s murderer with the help of a mute child. Learning about the lawyers own difficult past added another dimension to this story. Solid mystery with a complete ending that I would like to see expand to a book 2.

226,5.0 out of 5 stars INTENSE!,"On the outside they were the golden family with the perfect life. On the inside they built the perfect lie. A young nanny who plunged to her death, or was she pushed? A nine-year-old girl who collects sharp objects and refuses to speak. A lawyer whose job it is to uncover who in the family is a victim and who is a murderer. But how can you find out the truth when everyone here is lying? Rose Barclay is a nine-year-old girl who witnessed the possible murder of her nanny – in the midst of her parent’s bitter divorce – and immediately stopped speaking. Stella Hudson is a best interest attorney, appointed to serve as counsel for children in custody cases. She never accepts clients under thirteen due to her own traumatic childhood, but Stella’s mentor, a revered judge, believes Stella is the only one who can help. From the moment Stella passes through the iron security gate and steps into the gilded, historic DC home of the Barclays, she realizes the case is even more twisted, and the Barclay family far more troubled, than she feared. And there’s something eerie about the house itself: It’s a plastic house, with not a single bit of glass to be found. As Stella comes closer to uncovering the secrets the Barclays are desperate to hide, danger wraps around her like a shroud, and her past and present are set on a collision course in ways she never expected. Everyone is a suspect in the nanny’s murder. The mother, the father, the grandmother, the nanny’s boyfriend. Even Rose. Is the person Stella’s supposed to protect the one she may need protection from? My Thoughts: From the very beginning of House of Glass, I was caught up in the family dynamics and in Stella’s efforts to help the family through the custody agreement.  I was reminded of my own career in social work, trying to choose what was best for the child or children. We learn about the strange setting in the home, from its old fashioned arrangement to the absence of anything glass.  No glass anywhere, from the picture frames missing to only plastic dinnerware. Slowly we realize that there is so much more going on, and just when we think we have figured it all out, we are stunned by what is really happening.  A tense five star read. *** Read more",10 Aug 2024,Laurel-Rain Snow,5.0,B0CGRZHX2H,"https://www.amazon.com/House-Glass-Novel-Sarah-Pekkanen-ebook/dp/B0CGRZHX2H/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

243,4.0 out of 5 stars Great Story; Not So Great Storytelling,"“I believe we can help each other. You wish for everyone to know your name. I wish for no one to know mine.” Outstanding historical fiction, with sides of literature, romance, and humor. With a slight blush of fantasy. Two novels and a play interlace. From such limited and dubious sources as an astrologer’s diary, Picoult creates a fully realized, sympathetic Elizabethan protagonist. A Shakespearean tragicomedy of errors, mistaken identities, and star-crossed lovers. Picoult expands her reputation. “Your play isn’t about history. What happened to Emilia is still happening, every day.” This who-really-wrote-Shakespeare theory works better than most. Certainly more entertaining. Like The Da Vinci Code, Picoult wraps her advocacy in fiction. Better fiction than Brown’s. Modern parallel story is equally satisfying and frustrating—intentionally—despite it being her hand puppet for data dumps and lectures. ""Explosives. Opioids. Nuclear weapons. None of them could hold a candle to hope, the most dangerous commodity in the world."" Loved the story but miss the subtlety of Picoult’s earlier works. Could be dozens of pages shorter if Picoult resisted the urge to explain everything. Occasionally two or three times. To assure you get it, she underlines key points. Let the reader figure it out.  The first hundred pages are the worst, so stick with it. Wanted to rate it higher—even read the book a second time—but while the story is great the storytelling isn’t quite. “I can’t believe you’re quoting Shakespeare to convince me.” “I’m quoting Emilia Bassano.” “Just think, two weeks ago you only wanted a play produced. Now you want biblical vengeance.” “I’m an overachiever.” Quibbles? The veneer over her agenda is occasionally transparent. Of course it’s agenda-driven; isn’t most art? (Agenda are like noses: we all have them but see our own less than others.) Even though I agree with some of her polemics, they’re still polemics. Hard sell; Soft pornography; coarse language. You’re warned. ""Being named was important. It gave you credit for the work you put into the world, but it also held you responsible for your words and deeds when you hurt the people you loved, even inadvertently."" Read more",07 Sep 2024,R.

244,5.0 out of 5 stars Utterly Amazing,"This book was one of the best researched and well thought out dual timeliness novels I've ever read. The history as well as the fiction held me captive and drew me so far into the story that I've researched things on my own to explore the people Jodi brought (back) to life. Jodi shines a spotlight on the most uncomfortable aspects of society; racism, lack of equality, and the silencing of women. I lived for Emilia. I was heartbroken, triumphant, broken, resigned, and determined right along with her. All of the characters; the Countess, Hunsdon, Bess, Kit, Shakespeare, Henry, Alphonso, and Alma were all so well thought out and realistic that I had genuine attachments and feelings about all of them. The world was so well built and outlined that I could see the places described and live those moments as if I were there. I hope the things from the book actually somewhat lined up with her real life. I agree with Jodi that she deserves that little bit of happiness. I'd love for more to be found to support this alternative history and for credit to be given where it's rightfully due.

I have been reading Jodi Picoult books for as long as I can remember.  In fact, her books are what made me fall in love with reading.  This book, however, was on a whole new level.  This book was unlike her other books and I absolutely loved it.  I say this after I read each one of her books, but I’ve found a new favorite with this one! By Any Other Name is written about two women, and told centuries apart.  One of the women is the real author of Shakespeare’s plays.  The other is a woman in the present day, who is having a hard time getting her play produced until it is submitted under a different name.  The amount of research that went into this book baffles me.  I have no idea who Picoult does what she does, but there’s a reason she is one of the greatest.  The author’s note at the end should not be skipped.  I read it twice! 💙Historical Fiction 💙Dual Timelines 💙Strong Female Characters 💙Shakespeare 💙Dual POV 💙Well-Researched 🎧This book is 525 pages long, and I paired the physical book with the audiobook.  I would listen to the audiobook during the day, and then read the physical book in the evening.  While it consisted of a full cast of narrators, it was mostly narrated by Billie Fulford-Brown and Laura Benanti, who were just spectacular.

252,4.0 out of 5 stars Worth reading,"Growing up in the Seattle area myself, and having been exposed to Gates since the beginning, I found this book to be fairly interesting in that it filled in some blanks on what he has been doing for the past 20 years, and what was behind his divorce. The author touched on Gates’ privilege growing up, but I felt understated it significantly. His father was literally one of the names in the top law firm in Seattle for decades, and although the firm has changed names, merged, etc, it still exists as K&L Gates even though Gates Sr. is no longer alive. His mother was on the board of regents at the University of Washington. It seemed the book was 50% about Gates and the rest about billionaires in general, their power, influence, spending, philanthropy, etc. with plenty of anecdotes and examples from the likes of Buffett, Bezos, etc. Even though she doesn’t really explicitly say it until the last pages, it’s clear Gates possesses a massive ego, hubris, etc. despite the best efforts of his handlers to keep that side of him tamped down. He seems incapable of admitting he’s wrong, even refusing to cop to his serial philandering. It’s great that he’s donating so much of his money to worthy causes, but even that comes across as smarmy because of the publicity seeking from his handlers, especially lobbying for a Nobel Prize… unbelievable.

253,2.0 out of 5 stars Disappointing: Weak reporting lacks focus,"I agree with the need for a book deeply reporting on Mr. Gates and his foundation’s activities, and about his post-CEO impact and life. I am not necessarily an admirer or detractor but would like to know more. I made it halfway through 2016’s No Such Thing as a Free Gift: The Gates Foundation and the Price of Philanthropy and had to put it down, as it began as a dissertation and relates general critiques of the foundation’s programmatic philosophies (e.g., neoliberal educational reform) rather than an actual exposé. So I was quite excited to pick up Billionaire, Nerd, Savior, King, written by New York Times reporter Anupreeta Das and informed by ""hundreds"" of mostly anonymous interviews. Wow, was I disappointed. I am giving it two stars because I would not recommend reading it. It is fine so far as it goes as a summary of past reporting on Gates in recent years. In my view, the book’s original sin is it adds little, and nothing of note, to others’ reporting. Nobody is perfect, so delving into a famous and powerful individual would presumably dig up some dirt. Das doesn’t break any news here. Gates’s 2000 marital affair has been reported. She mentions another ‘rumored’ one in 2010 with an international bridge player. I am not excusing such behavior; frankly, I find it abhorrent. But don’t color me surprised to see that the richest man in the world had extracurricular activities. Melinda herself was a former Microsoft subordinate. More bizarre and perhaps intriguing in what is termed Gates’s ‘relationship’ with Jeffrey Epstein. Das tells us about this ‘relationship’ on page 1, which led me to surmise that the book would either be a hit job or break a bona fide scandal. Das devotes a chapter to this supposed relationship. Let me sum it up for you. The bottom line is that Epstein was a con artist and criminal abuser who claimed he was a billionaire to ingratiate himself with billionaires and royalty and his many victims. In the wake of the Giving Pledge, Epstein claimed he wanted to help billionaires donate to the Gates Foundation. If Gates – one of the world’s most recognizable people, who has traveled with a team of armed guards for more than thirty years – did anything other than speak with Epstein about the latter’s attempted philanthropic cons, which led to nothing, then no person has ever discovered it. My point is that at this moment in time, the intimation that anything else happened with Gates and Epstein is in the realm of conspiracy theories. Prince Andrew he is not. Another regrettable part of the book is three chapters dedicated to what could be characterized as armchair social science about “billionaires” and “nerds.” Chapter 1 is entitled “Why We Love Billionaires” while Chapter 10 – I am not making this up – is “Why We Hate Billionaires.” Chapter 2 is “The Ur Nerd of Capitalism,” a wandering discourse on the concept of a nerd. There are only 10 chapters in the book. These three have little to do with Gates and instead offer disjointed paragraphs on Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Occupy Wall Street, Bernie Sanders, and so forth. Reading canned billionaire biographies and the etymology of “nerd” is something I could do on my own, if I wanted to, and not why I bought the book. (I have read Ashlee Vance’s excellent biography of Elon Musk, which shows how interesting such subject matter can be in the right hands.) Presumably these 3 incongruous chapters were appended to boost page count from roughly 200 to 300. I do not think they were written by AI (too smooth for that) but it would not surprise me if they were initially drafted by AI. A chapter on Gates’s relationship with Warren Buffett is more revealing for what is says about the author’s tilted viewpoint. Over the last 20 years, Buffett has kept his promise to dedicate most of his philanthropic resources to the Gates Foundation for Bill, Melinda (before the divorce) and their staff to dispose of as they see fit. Buffett, 94, recently announced that, upon his death, his assets would go to his children’s foundations. Neither his children nor their foundations were equipped to manage such sums of money 20 years ago. Das reinterprets Buffet’s planned bequests to his children as ‘evidence’ of a schism between Gates and Buffett. So let me get this theory straight. During his lifetime, Buffett picked Bill and the Gates Foundation, of all the people and organizations in the world, to receive most of his donations of Berkshire Hathaway stock, his life’s work. Buffett has donated about $40 billion to Bill’s foundation. And supposedly they have a bad relationship? Buffett emailed with the author at length (Bill and his people declined interviews) and politely denied the schism theory. It is curious to me, then, while dedicating a chunk of her book to her perception of something that does not exist, that the author does not do much to examine the impact of these gifts on global public health, which seems to be fertile ground to explore. The chapter on Cascade Investments, which manages Gates’s wealth, does contain some allegations of bullying by the longtime manager there. But it is not an exaggeration to say the Wikipedia entry on Cascade has more substance. Again, it has all been reported better elsewhere. There are a number of typos in the book (“riding golf” instead of horses was memorable) and strange, likely inaccurate, personal attacks (“On one of his earliest trips to India for Microsoft, Gates remarked to a colleague how surprised he was that so many people in the country spoke English, apparently unaware of its legacy of British colonialism.”). This should be compared with Das’s saintly portrayal of Melinda Gates, who after she received $12 billion in the divorce, “has created a firm very much in her own image, setting a tone that combines ambition with humility, and expressing empowerment by embracing vulnerability. She speaks the language of empathy, compassion, and human connection…” etc.). Das also has a penchant for overwrought and unnecessary language. Her chapter “Global Savior, Big Philanthropist” begins: “The history of the world is heavy with tales of epidemics, disease, and death. Terrifying plagues, pestilences, and poxes have felled populations throughout the centuries. Fevers and humors, outbreaks and contagions have confounded generations of medical experts.” No kidding. Or, she informs us: “Marriages are phantasmagorias. They change shape, they confound, they bewilder. Sometimes, they start out sturdy as a tree trunk and end up fragile as splinters…” and so on. Elsewhere, she writes: “It takes a village to raise a child. It also takes a village to support a billionaire’s interests and activities.” Later she mentions Donald Trump, who, she explains, was “Obama’s successor” as president. This is just some of the phraseology I noted in the margins. I did enjoy the chapter on “The Pivot” exploring how Bill’s imagemakers transformed him from titan of industry to the Mister Rogers of global health. And as I said, it’s a fine summary of Bill Gates for those who might be interested in that. It is biased but not to the point of being unreadable. It would have been nice if the author had given Gates some credit for being the world’s most generous philanthropist. I did not set out to write a mostly negative review. Two stars is not one star, and Das is not a terrible researcher or writer, for the most part. But in looking back I have to admit the book is just not very good. My guess is that Das set out to do a real exposé but after a year or two she didn’t find enough dirt and this is the result.

254,"3.0 out of 5 stars A stilted, interesting read","This book is well researched but seems to start and end with a bias, painting Gates as a well intentioned prometheus, critiquing his longstanding use of a media team, his obvious personal indiscretions(and worse), and even his philanthropic priorities and influence.  There is a strong undercurrent of resentment for Gates and to a lesser extent for other billionaires who choose to give away their money, based on their own priorities and actual data based outcomes… and talk about it.

269,5.0 out of 5 stars IN THOSE RAW FIRST WEEKS OF 1993..THE WORLD TURNED ITS ATTENTION OUR WAY,"WE BURN DAYLIGHT Based on the events that took place in Waco in 1993... the Branch Davidian cult and David Koresh...we get an insightful and in depth perspective of what may or may not have actually happened.  This is historical fiction at its VERY BEST. Waco, 1993.  We meet Roy who is the fourteen year old son of the local sheriff.  A band of people have set up home and word has it they are trouble.  Led by Perry...otherwise known as the Lamb...people have come from all over the world to be with him and follow him.  There are rumors of illegal weapons, abuse, and the Lamb having relations with young girls. Enter into the picture fourteen year old Jaye.  Her mother has heard about the Lamb and decides to leave California and join his followers.  Jaye, loving her mom, doesn't want her to go alone. The compound has many rules and restrictions.  People work hard but life is not easy.  The Lamb's fanatical faith and beliefs are preached to others continually and these people are willing to do anything for him.  Except for Jaye.  She hates the Lamb with a passion and stands up to him constantly. Worlds collide when Roy and Jaye meet. As the reader we learn the points-of-view from the government, the local sheriff and his family, the people in town, and the people living in the compound with the Lamb.  Each chapter is narrated by either Roy or Jaye as we move towards April 19, 1993. This is a horrifying look back at the siege of the compound in Waco.  This is a love story.  Bret Anthony Johnston's writing is beautiful.  His prose is pure magic.  There is an aura of constant tension and suspense not knowing what will happen next...yet knowing the outcome.

271,5.0 out of 5 stars A Tragedy,"We Burn Daylight By Bret Anthony Johnston If you were around in 1993 you must remember the Branch Davidians, a religious sect led by David Koresh, and the horror when the Davidian compound in Waco Texas is besieged by our government for 51 days. The standoff ended with a horrific fire which killed nearly 80 people, including many children. The story of Waco is true. Here it serves as the background for a fictional ""Romeo and Juliet"" story of two characters who, like Shakespeare's characters, come to a sad end. Jaye is the daughter of a devout follower and Roy is the son of the local sheriff. They are in love, and Roy wants to save Jaye from what is coming. But Koresh has other plans. The title, ""We Burn Daylight"", is in fact a quote from Romeo and Juliet. This too is a tragedy.

The story is told in the voices of two teens, one the son of the towns sheriff, the other a girl in the cult.  Roy is missing his brother in Afghanistan and Jaye wants nothing to do with the cult, but is trying to protect her mother.  When the two meet at a gun show, there are instant sparks, but is there any future for the two.  When Roy discovers a secret at the cult he keeps it to himself, but when he learns of the raid and the standoff that enfolds, he’s not so sure he should have kept things to himself.  The story takes place years later with alternating chapters in Roy and Jaye’s voices interspersed with a podcast.  While an interesting premise and I liked the Roy and Jaye characters, I wasn’t all that invested in the story.  Thank you to Random House and NetGalley for an ARC of this book.

273,4.0 out of 5 stars Historical fiction of the Branch Davidians,"We Burn Daylight is a historical fiction novel based on the events at the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas, in 1993. Bret Anthony Johnston creates a character, Jaye, who is forced to live in the compound because of her mother’s desires, and another character, Roy, who lives in Waco with his father, the sheriff. The young kids meet and immediately Roy develops quite the crush for Jaye. He does everything he can to be in her path as often as possible, which is rare based on the control her leader The Lamb has on all occupants of the farm. Law officers increase their suspicions of what’s going on at the farm. A rumor is strongly suspected that they’re amassing large quantities of firearms and military weapons. Roy and Jaye know it’s just a matter of time before the lid blows off, but Jaye can’t convince her mother to leave. The characters are believable, and the plot is, well, we already know how it turns out, but the ending is given a reprieve. I only have one issue with the revised ending; the kids are too young to do what they accomplish. Stranger things have happened, though, and it leaves the legacy of horror in Waco with a sliver of hope.

275,5.0 out of 5 stars Worth the wait… and 2025 can’t come soon enough,"Louise Penny’s latest offering, *The Grey Wolf*, reads like a delightful puzzle that would intrigue even the most discerning sleuth. Set in the quaint village of Three Pines, it draws readers into a world where charm and menace intertwine, reminiscent of the best in classic mysteries. At the heart of this tale lies a chilling murder, the intricacies of which unfold with a deftness that would make Hercule Poirot himself nod in approval. Penny excels at crafting a narrative rich with red herrings and unexpected revelations, maintaining an atmosphere of suspense that grips from the very first page. Her characters, each painted with a fine brush, exhibit a depth that invites both suspicion and empathy, embodying the myriad complexities of human nature. As the story unfolds, the reader is treated to the sharp wit and keen observations that are hallmarks of the genre. Penny’s prose flows with an elegance that evokes the best of Golden Age crime fiction, combining intrigue with an insightful exploration of morality and human connection. The dialogue crackles with a subtle humor that enlivens the dark undercurrents of the plot. In The Grey Wolf, Penny invites us to contemplate not only the motives behind a heinous crime but also the profound bonds that unite the inhabitants of this seemingly idyllic village. It is a tale that lingers in the mind, a testament to Penny’s status as a master storyteller in the tradition of Agatha Christie. Readers will find themselves eagerly awaiting the next twist in this captivating series. Read more",01 Nov 2024,Grant E.

279,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best of the best,"Louise Penny continues to develop as a writer. I know, I know, many of you think she has always been outstanding. Within the relatively narrow confines of the crime mystery genre, you might be right. But she has become so much better than that. Go back to her first Gamache book and compare it to The Grey Wolf, and you will see what I mean. This woman can write. I can write a very good non-fiction sentence. I can even pile them up in paragraphs. I wrote a PhD dissertation. But I am no writer. This woman is a writer. I have thought about writing a book or two -- even did a detailed outline of one. But the task seemed so daunting, and I did not have the confidence to do it. Penny has all the confidence in the world now. I am still not fond of her prissy little village and most of her characters. But she simply writes so compellingly about them. I am not sure I would like Louise Penny, but I sure do like what she writes. As to The Grey Wolf, it arrived on my Kindle from an advance purchase last night. I was going to ignore it and get some sleep. My little dog who sleeps with me (on my pillow) was restless. Her brother passed away last week, and we are still unsettled. It has affected her digestion and my sleep. At 12:30 AM, I cracked open The Grey Wolf. Big mistake. I was still reading at 5 AM. Penny's story development is so much more mature now than even in her mid-series books. In this book, the characters do not know whom they can trust. They only know that corruption has invaded the Surété and even high levels in the civil government of Canada. Unexpected characters from past books pop up mysteriously. Family matters long settled flame up again. I have written in earlier reviews that I was not fond of Inspector Gamache. The written character left me a bit cold. My attitude was changed when I binge-watched the TV series, in which a brilliant stroke of casting gave us the perfect actor playing the role of Gamache. Alfred Molina redeemed the character for me. I will finish the book tonight. I won't write any spoilers. In fact, I think I will cut off this review at this point and leave you all hanging. You really should read The Grey Wolf. It is the best of Louise Penny's series, and that position makes it the best of the best in the eyes of her fans and beyond.

281,,Another well written romp with lots of twists but a bit less character development than usual.  Three Pines friends make hurried cameos and the people who know what’s going on leave opaque clues rather than simply telling what they know.  That’s ok because it keeps up the suspense but it bothers me that the author forgot that Lacoste adopted a female child a few books back.  That isn’t the sort of detail one forgets and there are multiple references to her family and 2 boys that left me scratching my head. Read more,05 Nov 2024,L.

282,,"Another fantastic story from Louise Penny. I love everything about Armand Gamache. His quiet fortitude, his relentless search for the truth and his compassion and love for his family. This has all of that and more. It kept me gripped from beginning to end as each clue is unfurled. This was a more political/terrorism story which normally I am not a huge fan of. I prefer a good murder story but it still kept me interested right the way through. Plenty of heart in the mouth moments. Would also have liked more of Three Pines and its inhabitants but I realise that would make the story too unrealistic for murder to be in such a small place all the time! A well written, thought out storyline and I look forward to the next thrilling case of Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, head of homicide of the Surete of Quebec. Loved it!

288,5.0 out of 5 stars Two thumbs up,Excellent read. Kept my interest throughout. However I was a bit confused when the narration was from the teenage Greta I didn’t know whether it was from her in her teens or from Greta as an adult looking back as she remembered it. The end has a nice twist as all good novels do. I think it would have been better if I had read its predecessor “the boy in the striped pajamas”. Still very good read.

291,4.0 out of 5 stars Suspend logic,"I thought this book to be an interesting read. I enjoy historical fiction, so this novel reads well in that regard. But it stretches the imagination to think that Gretel’s mother, a German trying to hide her German nationality, would go to Paris with her 15 year old daughter after the war. It’s not logical! Perhaps, if they had gone to Switzerland or Sweden or another country that had been neutral during that period it might make sense. But really, you have to suspend belief to think she would have gone to Paris. Then, I find it hard to believe that Gretel had so much guilt. She was a child/teen when the events happened. She lived in a controlling environment and had been essentially brainwashed from an early age. It was like being in a cult. She knew right from wrong in the context of which she had grown up. This is not to absolve her of all actions, but really the guilt seems overdone considering the lack of control she had over anything. A psychologist could best speak to this, but we do know that a persons brain is often not fully developed until their late to mid- twenties. The heavy guilt about the war did not ring true. Maybe she would have some about her brother, but the rest just seemed a contrived story line. Perhaps if she had been in her late teens this overwhelming guilt trip might make sense. Also, the fact that Gretel did not realize that David was so obviously Jewish given his surname and her background does not ring true. Again, have to suspend belief and go with the storyline I have not read The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, so perhaps that would have given greater context to this novel. I found the storyline regarding Heidi and her concern for Henry much more believable and realistic. Although, in some ways I question how likely it was that she and her husband would ended up living in the same building as her daughter that she had given up at birth. Overall, an enjoyable story as long as you don’t think logically about certain aspects of the novel.

292,5.0 out of 5 stars A different twist to a WWII (Holocaust )story,"After reading many novels about WWII and the Holocaust, I stayed clear from reading books about that time period. My friends and I are avid readers of historical  fiction, but it seemed we burnt out on that topic.  However, All the Broken Places was well written, fast paced, and suspenseful.  John Boyne created such a deep character, who you loved and loathed.  He enlightened my awareness of the struggles/guilt of POSTwar Germans who were part of the Nazi regime, not by choice and the young “innocent “ Germans. I highly recommend this book with a different twist and perspective. I’m looking forward to reading another Boyne novel.

297,,"I had not previously read The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, to which this novel forms a sequel, but it is not a requirement to do so and your enjoyment of this book is not in any way compromised if you have not read the earlier novel. I found All the Broken Places to be such a fine piece of writing that I immediately bought The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas and read this immediately afterwards. John Boyle is a very fine writer indeed. I have read almost all of his novels now - they are beautifully written and always complex and layered, but with a very clear narrative line. This book is no exception and although The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is a fine novel in its own right, I enjoyed All the Broken Places, its sequel, much more. It is so finely written and so beautifully structured that I find it difficult to find the words to describe the quality of this work. Bruno’s sister, Gretel, is now in her nineties and living in a very privileged part of London - haunted by her past, by the loss of her brother and by the guilt she still feels as the daughter of a Nazi family who were directly involved in the Holocaust: Gretel’s father was the Commandant at Auschwitz. The story is told by switching from the present to the past. Although it is not a particularly long novel, it is epic in its themes and in the scope of the narrative. John Boyne’s characters are finely drawn - each individual and real, and yet he achieves this strength of characterisation through an economy of means. I love John Boyne’s ‘voice’ as a writer. The language is accessible, the voice simple and direct, and the narrative carries you swiftly and easily, despite the complexity of the ideas embraced here, and the layers within the story itself. He does not shy away from moral complexity - Gretel’s story and the questions it raises for her likewise challenge the reader’s sense of moral values. If you have never read a novel by John Boyne this is as good a place as any to start. It is an utterly human story, richly told, and one of his very best books.

298,5.0 out of 5 stars The books are beautifully illustrated with Dr. Seuss's signature whimsical style!,"The Dr. Seuss's Beginner Book Boxed Set Collection is an absolute delight for children and adults alike.

The rhyming text is engaging and makes reading fun, helping children develop language skills and a love for books. What sets this boxed set apart is its durability and presentation. The sturdy box keeps the books organized and protected, making it perfect for gifting or storing on a bookshelf. The set also makes for an excellent introduction to Dr. Seuss's works for children who are just beginning to read independently. As a parent, I appreciate the educational value of these books combined with the entertainment they provide.

300,5.0 out of 5 stars I think you'll find a use for Seuss.  A use for Seuss....,"Recently I bought this as a gift as buying five in bulk would save about 45% over buying these books individually.  This is five separate books in a boxed set so you could gift each book separately if you choose. What amazes me is how great they are for a child starting to read. Happy Birthday, according to the Guinness Book of Records is the most sung song in the world. Happy Birthday contains 16 words, of which only two are not repeated many times.  In fact it has only six unique words.  Part of the ease of understanding comes with repetition. Green Eggs and Ham has about 60 unique words and 500 to 600 words overall, very cleverly done, and outstanding for a child learning to read, with entertaining color illustrations on each page, great rhyme, repetition and variation and parallel structure, even reversal. Here is an example with parallel structure and rhyme: So I will eat them in a box And "" ""  ""  ""  with a fox. ""  "" ""  ""  ""  in a house. ""  "" ""  ""  ""  with a mouse. ""  "" ""  ""  ""  here and there. ""  ""  ""  ""  ""  anywhere. Say!  I will eat them ANYWHERE. Now see if you can sing these words to the tune of Happy Birthday.  I think you will find the meter is similar.  It's quite ingenious.  And I think Green Eggs and Ham will encourage a child to try new things. And a reversal pattern: I am Sam.  Sam I am. Hop on Pop is a great first book for a child to make rhyme associations through, very entertaining and for a beginner. Fox in Socks is full of tongue twisters. One fish two fish red fish blue fish.  Notice the repetition through parallel structure. The Cat in the Hat reputedly contains 220 unique words given by an educator to Seuss to rhyme as the essential words for a child to learn, and created the memorable absurdity of two children and a prankish cat. Seuss won  a Pulitzer prize in 1984 for his overall literary work, so if you want to get your child or someone else's to read Pulitzer prize winning literature at an early age, you need look no further. If you like this consider also The Bippolo Seed and Other Lost Stories , another Seuss book, seven stories in a single book, for the price of a single story book. Recently,  I had the opportunity to try out these books on my niece who is 4.  She had some familiarity with Green Eggs and Ham.  Even though her reading skills are not fully developed she was totally engaged with this story and able to anticipate several passages.  I was quite impressed with her level of focus and engagement, and she was able to point out the different characters in the pictures and name them.  I then read Cat in the Hat changing the names of the children to her and her brothers name which further increased her level of engagement. It works on adults too. My other sister had used it with her kids, and was able to recite an entire page looking at me without looking at the book, slightly crossing her eyes as she spoke. Update 12/20/2017. The children to whom I have given these books remember and their parents mention that they were a great help in getting their children interested in reading. I know you will enjoy these absurd and surreal stories, and I hope you found this helpful.

301,5.0 out of 5 stars A Universal Gift for All Children and Always an Entertaining Read for Both Adults and Children,"I believe that there are things that we receive that are priceless, both in terms for value and sentimentality. The Dr. Seuss’s hardcover books are entertaining for a child, fun to read as an adult, and the clever concepts, tongue twister rhymes and verses, never gets old or stale, even when read 30 years later. There are five separate hardcovers books in this collection, and they come protected in a fitted cardboard sleeve. Each book is one complete story, with funny characters, unusual adventuresome plots, and all have happy endings. The stories are all illustrated and the font is large and easy to read, the tongue twisters are catchy and fun and the plot of the stories move at a smooth and easy pace. These stories and pictures capture a toddler’s attention, and they listen without any restless squirming. When my son was at that very young age he always requested that I read the same story ‘again’. He kept his full collection and now that he has two young children of his own, both he and my daughter-in-law read them to their children as part of their bedtime ritual. Since all these stories are fun and amusing, and without any scary portions, they make the perfect transition from sleepy wakefulness to a peaceful sleep. However, I bought this starter set for my niece who has one-year old twins. My niece and her husband live in a small apartment with very limited space and with all the toys received from both families, and all the relatives and friends they have run out of room. Therefore if everyone would just send the children a birthday card and come for a visit that would suffice for their birthday.  Unfortunately, I live over 3,000 miles away and therefore a ‘drop-over’ for a visit is not possible for me. Therefore, I felt compelled to send something more than just birthday cards, and sent this set of books as well. Both her and her husband loved this gift. Books take up a minimum of space, and since she is an avid reader she has ‘story-time’ with her children twice a day, afternoons and at bedtime, and furthermore she enjoyed the Dr. Seuss books from when she was toddler and never grew tired of his stories, even as she grew older. This is an ideal and universal gift for all children. No matter our age, these books are entertaining, and interesting for adults to read out loud with humorous tongue twisters, and sure to delight all girls and boys. This is a sensational start to introduce the joy of reading, and a perfect start for any child’s book collection.

309,5.0 out of 5 stars Everything a Riordan fan could want,"4.5 stars! Rick Riordan has done it again! THE SWORD OF SUMMER follows what has become Riordan’s trademark formula: take an ancient mythology and see what would happen if it were real, here and now. It’s a formula that works, in large part because of the imagination and humor Riordan brings to his books. The combination kept me veering from suspense to outright laughter, interspersed with moments of sympathy and even grief. I worried at first that Magnus would prove to be a Percy knockoff. The two characters share a similar predilection for snark as well as an impulse to protect others, particularly the innocent. Like Percy in his first few books, Magnus has lost his mother. But Magnus is older and little darker; he’s more of a realist, or perhaps a pessimist, than Percy, and thanks to several years spent homeless, he’s far more streetwise and wary. He’s also (it’s hardly a spoiler at this point) Annabeth’s cousin. I was just hoping for a few passing references to Annabeth, so I was downright delighted to get several whole scenes with her. The scene where the two of them compete for whose life is the weirdest without actually telling each other the truth made me ridiculously happy. And though I have my fingers crossed for a major crossover when this series is finished, there are hints that it might actually take place within this series, which would make me (and a lot of other people) very happy as well. Riordan has been working to add more diversity to his books, and he does a great job with it in The Sword of Summer. Of course, there’s the built-in diversity of Norse myth, with its frost giants and fire giants and dwarves and elves, but there’s also diversity among the Valkyrie and the einherjar, the fallen warriors brought to Valhalla. Besides Magnus, who is largely of Norse descent, there’s Sam(ira) el-Abbas, a Valkyrie and daughter of a Norse god; T.J., the son of an escaped slave and a Norse god, who fought for the Union; a half-troll; a deaf elf and a dwarf who’s more into fashion than crafting things; an Irish girl. . . you get the idea. And it works really well, because Riordan never makes the mistake of making the character’s race, ethnicity, or disability into their distinguishing characteristic. Sam is from a Muslim family; she wears a hijab, at least when she might see someone she knows (and the hijab itself is more than it appears). But her culture is only one aspect of who she is, and it’s not the most important one — not to Magnus, not to Riordan, and not to the reader. Hearth’s deafness means he communicates with Magnus and Blitz (the dwarf) in ASL, but he’s not a token deaf person by any means. It’s part of him, but it doesn’t define him. The humor in the book had me literally laughing aloud, and stopping to read out choice bits to my husband. Here’s one of my favorites, referring to how a certain magical item was made: “. . . with the most powerful paradoxes in the Nine Worlds — WiFi with no lag, a politician’s sincerity, a printer that prints, healthy deep-fried food, and an interesting grammar lecture!” “Okay, yeah,” I admitted. “Those things don’t exist.” Then there are Magnus’s various comments on the Norse habit of naming, well, pretty much everything. (“Is this potato called Steve?”) And his general snarkiness: when he and some friends literally jump off a cliff, he reflects in the first-person narrative, “Because, you know, what are friends for?” His friends are, for the most part, able to keep up their end: Sam is particularly good at riposte and sarcasm. One of the best bits (not from Sam) is a direct jab at the Percy Jackson series; it’s glorious and much to good to spoil, so you’ll just have to be on the lookout for it. And there are a number of pop-culture references, including to various Marvel and DC superhero franchises, that will make you chuckle as well. The humor scattered liberally throughout the book helps to balance the rather stark, death-doom-and-glory quality of the Norse mythos. To be honest, I had wondered before I read it whether Riordan could pull this series off, because so much of Norse myth is really dark and fatalistic. I needn’t have worried; Magnus’s snarky irreverence lightens the narrative without detracting from either his determination or his underlying anger at being pulled out of his life without so much as a by-your-leave — even if it wasn’t a very happy one. It’s his mother’s influence that really centers him, despite her absence. Another similarity with Percy, I guess: they both had mothers whose love and presence shaped their personalities for the better. (I would pay good money to see Magnus and Percy build a friendship and trade jokes; if we’re lucky, we’ll get that chance. Probably while they’re both fighting for their lives and the future of the world.) As for the plot, it’s everything a Riordan fan could want: plenty of well-described action, a series of quests or tasks, encounters with supernatural beings both friendly and unfriendly (and not infrequently untrustworthy), interspersed with short periods for rest, introspection, and character and relationship development. It’s a formula, sure, but a highly successful one — not to mention supremely entertaining. If you loved Riordan’s other books, you’re definitely going to enjoy these. If you haven’t read the others, you can easily jump in here. . . but after you read this book, I recommend backtracking to the preceding two series for the sheer fun of it.

310,5.0 out of 5 stars ... by Rick Riordan is an exciting book which is fun and easy to read,"Magnus Chase and the Sword of Summer by Rick Riordan is an exciting book which is fun and easy to read, and very well-written. Since it is mostly intended for younger audiences, I’m writing this review from a younger standpoint. With humor, sarcasm, adventure, excitement and fantasy all rolled up into one, it was a book that I simply could not put down until I finished. The way Riordan writes his characters makes the readers get attached, and they will feel like they must know what happens and won’t be able to stop until they get there. The reader is introduced to Magnus Chase, a homeless teenager trying to make his life on the streets of Boston. He doesn’t have much except for some homeless friends, two of whom will come to play big roles in the story—Hearthstone and Blitzen. On Magnus’s sixteenth birthday, he is plunged into the world of Norse mythology, never again to return to his “normal” human life, if it could even be called that in the first place. When Magus finds out that he is the son of a Norse god and that he is supposed to be a very important element in a quest to save the nine worlds, his world is flipped upside down. He and his friends must go on a series of sort quests, all leading up to their major quest—stop Fenris World from tearing free of his bindings and destroying the nine worlds. Like all of Riordan’s pieces, Magnus Chase is a quick, easy, and highly enjoyable read. The characters are a perfect balance of serious and comedic, which comes as a delight to the reader. With quotes like, “Weakly, I raised my free hand. I flipped him a gesture that he wouldn’t need sign language to understand,” it made me laugh on several occasions, which is one of the reasons why I enjoyed it so much (Riordan). The writing is easy to understand which makes it very pleasurable for the reader to get through. I never had to stop and think about what was going on because it was all written very clearly. Riordan is also very creative. The places and characters that he describes are whimsical and fun, and they put vivid images into the readers’ minds. The story moves at a nice, moderate pace and it is easy to keep up with all the events. Riordan writes teenagers in a way that is incredibly relatable and therefore makes the readers feel a connection to the story and its events. The one issue that people might have with this book is its predictability. Anyone who has read some of Riordan’s pieces before will be able to determine how the book is going to end. However, the events that lead up to that final event are entirely unpredictable, so it definitely does leave the reader wondering what is going to happen and how. In that way, there are most certainly parts of the story that the reader will not see coming so in my opinion the predictability was not a huge issue. The uniqueness and excitement of the events more than compensated for it. Overall, in my opinion the book was a huge success and I would highly recommend it. With humorous chapter titles that draw the reader in and chapters that end in cliffhangers, you will not want to put it down. The dialogue is hilarious, witty and sarcastic—everything that real-life teenagers are as well. If you enjoy fantasy, mythology, action, and humor, then this book is definitely the one for you.

316,5.0 out of 5 stars Compelling,"Michael Connelly is a must buy, must read author. This stand-alone is easy to follow. No editing errors, gratuitous violence or drag-you-down drama.  Not all questions are answered. Intriguing storyline about cold cases, trying to solve them, the always dangerous “office” politics and criminals.  Descriptive writing that draws the reader into each scene. Realistic procedures, actions and reactions. Believable characters with distinct personalities and emotional baggage. Thought-provoking and memorable dialogue. “You’ll learn this: Part of being a good detective is knowing your boss and how he thinks.” “Or how she thinks.” “Right. Your dad can tell you a lot about all of this.” “Uh, I don’t think my dad did too well in supervisor psychology.” “True.” “I mean, he threw a lieutenant through a glass window in the watch office once. They still talk about that at Hollywood Division.” “Then I’ll let you go. But remember, Ballard, think before you act. There are consequences. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The laws of politics are the same as the laws of physics.” I will re-read this story and always look forward to, pre-order when possible, new works by this author.

317,5.0 out of 5 stars Connelly is Still Back.  Great Book,"I enjoyed the book.  Well written and engaging.  Reasonable well developed and likable characters. The story line is kept moving because several investigations are developed simultaneously.  As one naturally slows, the story shifts to one of the other investigations.  This is 90% Renee.  Harry Bosch has only a walk on presence.  Connolly is obviously grooming Harry’s daughter Maddie for larger roles  I debated giving it 4 stars.  The investigations are interesting but, somewhat superficial.  But the story is so well written, it just keeps you engaged and satisfied.

318,4.0 out of 5 stars Renee is No Harry,"I've read every Connelly book three times and couldn't wait to devour yesterday's release. Lesson learned: Renee Ballard is very different from Harry, although they do share a tendency to defy the rules and lone-wolf their way around LAPD. However, Harry to me is soulful, intuitive, thoughtful and, yes, depressed a lot of the time. Renee, to me, comes across as immature, a bit hysterical and dramatic, and not exactly intuitive in the ways of a savvy officer. I didn't love the book -- and Maddie was even worse. Sadly, I won't be buying any more of MC's books if Renee is the protagonist. If only she had just been created as a little shrewder and a little better suited to the job. Disappointed -- probably the only person on the planet who feels this way, so I apologize. It WAS a great procedural, though.

319,"5.0 out of 5 stars Wild Plotting, But Should Be Ranked As One Of The Books Of The Year","Of course this is a wonderful book.  Michael Connelly is a top-five crime writer, a master of his craft.  He knows L.A. like the back of his hand and he represents it (and its travel times) realistically.  He has created iconic characters; he takes on significant themes and he can plot with exquisite skill. Two things concerning this book should be noted.  First, this is not really a ‘Ballard and Bosch novel’ so much as a Ballard and Bosch family novel.  Harry appears very briefly in the book (though at important moments), perhaps 5% of it.  His daughter Maddie joins Ballard’s cold case group (in important ways) for about 20% of the book.  This is not a criticism; it is simply a matter of truth in advertising. Second: the plot.  There are actually three plots.  Ballard’s team is searching for a serial rapist, primarily through DNA evidence.  Second, Ballard’s badge and gun are stolen while she is surfing and she must recover them or face threats of seeing her unit dissolved and herself transferred to far more trivial and far less interesting duty.  Finally (and this is the wild wrinkle), Maddie approaches Ballard with evidence of the identity of the murderer of the Black Dahlia, Elizabeth Short.  This titanic discovery is presented with a modern twist: the politicized D.A. refuses to prosecute (i.e. close the case, since the perp is long dead) because the chief of police backed a different candidate in his election and he values his personal spite over the public’s need to know and the remaining families of the other victims’ thirst for justice. The evidence for the identification of the Dahlia’s murderer turns on a relatively new technique, which involves the precise measurements of the elements of a person’s ear (more precise than fingerprint evidence).  This gives MC the opportunity to show his (very considerable) procedural chops. While the plotting is ‘different’ and totally unexpected it is also engaging and memorable. Bottom line: it is hard to rank a MC novel because the quality is always there.  I can only say that this should be ranked as one of the books of the year for 2024.  An easy 5 stars.

321,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Read!,"This is my first Michael Connelly book.  I read a review in the local paper and decided to give it a try.  So glad I did.  Found Mr. Connelly's writing style to be natural and concise.  Had an immediate liking towards protagonist Renee Ballard and did care about what would happen to her.  All of the team members of the Unsolved Cases Unit of the LAPD were believable and well-described.  Loved that they were unpaid volunteers.  What a great service to provide to the police department as a concerned citizen.  All that, along with the short chapters and descriptions of places made for an enjoyable page-turner.  ""The Waiting"" is #6 in the Ballard series.  I immediately went online and ordered numbers 1, 2 and 3.  So I have catching up to do!  Highly recommend this series!

327,5.0 out of 5 stars Copperhead Road,"In an interview with Ezra Klein on his podcast, Barbara Kingsolver said she wanted to write “the great Appalachian novel.” She conceded, however, that the notion “probably sounds ridiculous.” In particular, Kingsolver said she wanted to write about the fact that the people who live in Appalachia “are the most resourceful Americans you’re probably going to find anywhere.” Kingsolver, who was raised in rural Kentucky and now lives in rural Virginia, said she wanted to explore the shame she had internalized from her choice of a place to live. “How many people well-meaning people have asked me, ‘how could I live there in the middle of nowhere?’” said Kingsolver. “People, this is my everywhere. This is my everything.” Later in the chat: “Everybody looks down on the country people and the country people sort of absorb that. You can’t help but absorb it. So when I set out to write my great Appalachian novel. I was paralyzed with self-doubt because, I mean, my starting point was that I wanted to write about the opioid epidemic, which is become a huge assault on our culture, our families, our communities. It’s devastated so many of the good things about this region that we value and that we love. And so I wanted to write about these kids who’ve been damaged and this place that’s been damaged, and it seemed like a really hopelessly sad story. Plus, it’s about people that I didn’t feel the outer world cared about. And so I just really, I spent a couple of years walking around and around this story, trying to figure out how to break into that house because I really felt sure nobody wants to read it.” Well, Kingsolver was wrong. At least, she was wrong about the interest in her topic—not her take on the people of Appalachia. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and 85,000+ ratings on Amazon (4.6 stars). There’s so much to like about Demon Copperhead but one of the main things is that it’s so breezily readable. For a 546-page epic, it goes down fast. It’s episodic, a la Dickens, but the character flow is organic, unforced. Demon’s voice is engaging and his struggles are real, particularly when it comes to the challenges of the foster care system and the brutality of OxyContin addictions. Kingsolver’s empathy for addicts comes pouring out of the story. She is non-judgmental, plays it straight. Here is Demon, somewhat early on, looking back on the power of addiction: “I had roads to travel before I would know it’s not that simple, the dope versus the person you love. That a craving can ratchet itself up and up inside a body and a mind, at the same time that body’s strength for tolerating is favorite drug goes down and down. That the longer you’ve gone hurting between fixes, the higher the odds that you’ll reach too hard for the stars next time. That first big rush of relief could be your last. In the long run, that’s how I’ve come to picture Mom at the end: reaching as hard as her little body would stretch, trying to touch the blue sky, reaching for some peace.” That’s as good a passage about the feeling of addiction, and a description of its power, that I’ve ever read. (Kingsolver also read that section on Klein’s podcast.) Kingsolver is a deceiving writer. Her style is unassuming and keen-eyed. The text is full of specificity. And energy.  If you have any doubts about tackling this book because it looks too heavy, squash those notions.  Here’s the beginning of Chapter 34: “A lot of firsts that school year. First scrimmage, first JV game, first tackle, first passing yards made. First school dance, with an eighth-grader girl that was dead serious about it. So, my first real date, evidently. Angus and Sax went together dressed as Planet of the Apes, loser of their grade contest (Sax) being the human on a leash. This is Homecoming mind you, not Halloween, so. Not a date. But Angus took mine over, ordered the corsage from Walmart, took me to Goodwill where we found this dope white suit from the sixties. In my size, unbelievable. I’ve grown into my hands and feet by this point, and I’m pushing 6 feet. Thank you, Mattie Kate.” Mattie Kate is the housekeeper who worked for football Coach Wingate, where Demon lived while he was  being developed as a potential football star. There are plenty of characters to keep track of, but Kingsolver gives them juicy nicknames (again, a la Dickens) or colorful descriptions so they are easy to track. U-Haul. Fast Forward. Waddles. Mouse. If you know David Copperfield (it’s been decades since I read it) you’ll have a great time with what Kingsolver did with her names. For instance, Uriah Heep becomes Ryan Pyles. The “resourcefulness” of Demon is apparent in his stubborn ability to survive. He’s smarter than he acknowledges, and very observant. In Demon Copperhead, bad things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people, too. Many around Demon are not so fortunate and literally or metaphorically drown. You can’t help but think about the failure of our institutions around child welfare, the foster care system, adult welfare, and drug abuse. But Demon finds his talent, develops a passion, and puts it to use. Hello, the power of art. And love. Every great novel, and this is one, is a love story in the end. Demon Copperfield was written with passion for Kingsolver’s very personal reasons. The execution is a thing of beauty—and something we can all admire.

328,5.0 out of 5 stars A Vivid Tale of Resilience: Demon Copperhead with a Caveat,"Barbara Kingsolver's Demon Copperhead, a modern take on Charles Dickens' David Copperfield, is a powerful and evocative novel. While the story resonated with me on a personal level, I do want to address a potential drawback for some readers. Strengths: Vivid Setting and Characters: Kingsolver's Appalachia is beautifully rendered, transporting you to the heart of this rural community. The characters, especially Demon Copperhead himself, are well-developed and memorable. You'll find yourself invested in their struggles and triumphs. Modern Twist on a Classic:  Fans of Dickens' David Copperfield will appreciate the familiar themes and plot points, reimagined for a contemporary setting.  It's a fresh take on a beloved story. Powerful Exploration of Social Issues: Kingsolver tackles relevant issues like poverty, addiction, and the struggles of the working class. It's a thought-provoking read that sheds light on the challenges faced by many in America today. A Note on Content: Mature Content: It's important to acknowledge that the book contains some sexual content that might be inappropriate for younger readers or readers who prefer to avoid such material. While these scenes contribute to the overall story, they might be off-putting for some. Overall Recommendation: If you're looking for a well-written story with a strong sense of place and relatable characters, then Demon Copperhead is definitely worth considering. However, be mindful of the mature content if that's a concern for you.  Despite the caveat, Kingsolver's beautiful prose and exploration of social issues make this a compelling read for many.

329,4.0 out of 5 stars Heartbreaking & Fantastic,"Title of Review: Heartbreaking & Fantastic Title: Demon Copperhead Author: Barbara Kingsolver Date Purchased: 14 June 2023 Amount Paid: $15.99 Page number: 556 pages Genre: Fiction, Contemporary, Literary Fiction, Coming of Age Date of Review: 29 July 2024 Winner of Pulitzer Prize for Fiction: 2023 This was a book I read for my local book club. Set in the mountains of southern Appalachia, Demon Copperhead tells the story of a boy born to a teenage single mother in a single-wide trailer. With no assets beyond his deceased father's good looks and copper-colored hair, a sharp wit, and a fierce survival instinct, Demon navigates the modern challenges of foster care, child labor, failing schools, athletic success, addiction, disastrous loves, and devastating losses. Narrated in his own unflinching voice, Demon grapples with his invisibility in a culture that has largely abandoned rural communities. Inspired by Charles Dickens' David Copperfield, which drew from Dickens' own experiences with institutional poverty, Barbara Kingsolver transposes a Victorian epic to the contemporary American South. She channels Dickens' anger, compassion, and faith in storytelling's transformative power to give voice to a new generation of lost boys and those born into beautiful yet cursed places they can't imagine leaving. I think Kingsolver did a great job of telling the stories of damaged kids. I loved this book. Though it was hard to read in places—heartbreaking and sad—it was also heartwarming. The writing was superb, and the story captivated me from start to finish. It examined critical social issues while educating and showcasing the resilience of the human spirit.

330,,"Barbara Kingsolver is an exceptional author. The way she is able to weave a beautiful tale and bring the reader into the kind and circumstance of a character is magical. This is one of her best books. I could not put it down. I worked for years with trouble youth and this book is so accurate and so poignant to the real lived experience of the characters, it was haunting at times. These characters are going to stay with me for a very long time.

335,5.0 out of 5 stars What an amazing ride!,"I've only recently entered the magnificent world of Romantacy and this book has confirmed it's where I belong. After reading the ACOTAR series, as well as Fourth Wing, I picked up When the Moon Hatched by chance, and it has been an amazing adventure. The writing is so lyrical, it almost puts you in trance. From the first pages about the elements and how the world came to be, I have been unable to put this book down. I catch myself daydreaming about it when I can't read. I haven't felt that way about a book in quite some time. It is an intense slow-burn that feels right. It fits the characters well. The action scenes are so well written that you can practically hear it happening around you. There were times I felt confused about what was going on, but you realize that it's by design. The cloak of mystery stays with you throughout the story and it itself is an important character. I know many were put off by the glossary, but I found it very helpful. Its not meant for you to study before you jump into the story, it helps guide you throughout it. I didn't find myself needing it as I got further into the world because the context was more than enough. The world building is so well done that everything takes shape within the context of the actual story instead of drawn out explanations that you never truly understand. This is the kind of book you lose yourself in. Yes, there are many unanswered questions at the end, but, from what I understand, this is a series. Anxiously awaiting the next book, but even if there were no second book, I feel content enough with this story. Unanswered questions serve the imagination well.

337,5.0 out of 5 stars One of my favorite reads of the year!,"When I first started reading When the Moon Hatched, I found the pace a bit slow, as the world and its intricate magic system were carefully laid out. But once the story began to unfold, I was completely hooked. The true heart of this book lies in the intense, emotionally charged romance between Raeve, a skilled assassin and member of the Ath, and Kaan Vaegor, a king burdened by the loss of his loved one. Their relationship is fraught with strife and difficulty, as both characters are deeply scarred by their pasts and the circumstances that bring them together. Raeve’s life takes a dangerous turn when she becomes the target of a relentless bounty hunter employed by the crown, throwing her into a deadly game where survival is uncertain. Meanwhile, Kaan, driven by the unyielding pain of his loss, embarks on a quest for a moon shard in a desperate attempt to ease the never-ending ache in his heart. His journey leads him into Gore’s infamous prison, where he encounters Raeve, a fierce, shackled warrior who challenges everything he thought he knew. The romance between Raeve and Kaan is intense and layered with complexity. Their connection is both passionate and fraught with tension, as they navigate the dangers of their world and the personal demons that haunt them. The chemistry between them is palpable, filled with moments of raw emotion and witty banter that make their love story both compelling and deeply moving. Parker’s world-building is immersive, with dragons that become moons upon their death, a unique magical system, and the ever-present influence of the creators who never expected their dragons to fall. These elements add a layer of mystique and wonder to the story, making the stakes feel even higher as Raeve and Kaan navigate a world filled with danger and political intrigue. By the time I reached the climax, I was fully invested in the fates of these characters. The plot twists, emotional depth, and the intertwining of romance with fantasy kept me turning pages late into the night. This book is a fast-paced adventure that combines love, loss, mystery, and magic in a way that’s both engaging and deeply satisfying. When the Moon Hatched is perfect for fans of witty banter, strong, sassy protagonists, and complex worlds filled with magic and mystery. It’s a story that rewards readers with a thrilling ride and a romance that burns brightly against a backdrop of grief, danger, and political intrigue. I can’t wait for the sequel.

338,,"This was such an unexpected favorite. I picked this book up because I had started seeing it on Booktok and I am so glad I did. This story is winding and weaving and so well thought out and I am left with a sense of yearning for the next book. I am DYING to know what happens next after the epilogue. World Building We are introduced to a world with a very unique and interesting magic system. There are 5 gods Caelis God of Aether Bulder God of Ground Rayne Goddess of Water Clode Goddess of Air Ignos God of Fire The Fae in this world can harness their power if they are born with the ability to hear the song of a specific god. They can learn the language of that God and have power over their element. Some are born with no power wielding ability and some can harness multiple elements, however that is more rare. There is a caste system that revolves around this in the kingdoms, some kingdoms being much more harsh with the lower castes than others. It is also known that only one person can wield Aether at a time by wearing a crown that holds the Aether stone and this is a burden more than a gift as it drains the wearer of life. I need to re-read the first portion of this book to get a more intricate knowledge because the info that you have to take in right off the bat is really heavy to understand this world and I fully didn't absorb it all. The story is good enough for a re-read to understand it better. Characters I don't know how long this series is supposed to be but this book gave me a feeling that it will be relatively long OR quite an epic fantasy. We get the tip of what feels like an iceberg for every single character, there is so much that is intentionally not shared so that we are in the dark as much as some of the characters about major things and this is a fun reading experience. Raeve- This is our FMC. She is a lost person who doesn't remember her past at all. She just emerged a fully fledged warrior one day in her adulthood. She is what I would consider a gifted assassin, which is a trope that my simple self loves. She is FIERCE and so very confusing. Her backstory is so convoluted and broken and we don't get all of the puzzle pieces...at all....even as the book ends I still have so many questions about her. She has ""The Other"" living within her and we have no idea who or what this is. I have theories but that is all they are at this point. The other takes over her body and becomes another entity entirely. They share a body together. We also learn later on that she is the possible reincarnation (?) of the former Princess of the Shade. This character is so broken and so violent. She needs a lot of character development because in this book she is wild and angry and in denial of the truth that she knows she is purposefully mentally blocking. She refuses to heal and I need this to change at some point because if she continues like this I might lose interest. She is hard headed. I really like her wit and grit but I am ready for her evolution after 700 pages. Kaan- He is the King of The Burn and the MMC. He is a ferocious teddy bear who is so so mushy gushy gooey soft for the FMC. This poor man has been THROUGH it and he doesn't know so much of what happened to the FMC and watching him try to navigate their relationship and give her freedom through her memory loss is heart achingly touching. I love him. Dragons The dragons in this book are really cool. I was confused on and off for many chinks of this book because I had to flip back and forth to the glossary and definition section in the beginning but I really do love this world . The dragons were difficult to figure out at first. There are dragons from The Shade that are used to the colder winter temps. They can not thrive in other more arid and hot kingdoms. There are also breeds of dragon that are climatized to the hotter climates. They are all described differently with different character traits stratified by breed. If a person wants a dragon they can either steal and hatch an egg or they can try to woo an adult dragon. They seem to have bonds and communication with their rider and are a higher level than just a big beast. Overall Impressions All in all this book was a rollercoaster. I loved where it took me. Raeve is such a mystery and I really enjoyed following her through this unraveling. I also really love Kaan as a MMC. There is a revelation that is massive at the end of the book that is going to rock both of these characters to the core when they find out. It was a full mouth open omg to me too. There is a lot of loss and trauma in this book and I am hoping we get to feel more love and hope and see some healing in books to come because these characters are HURTING. I loved the emotional pull that the writer creates towards these characters and their situations. Nee. Thats a heart breaker right there.

343,"5.0 out of 5 stars Huge toolkit of actionable, practical, organized strategies to build positive habits","I've read a lot of books on changing behavior and building habits and James Clear's  Atomic Habits is my new favorite. This book is different from others in the way it covers an enormous amount of ground in the larger area of self-improvement while seamlessly tying all these ideas back into the central theme of habits. One of the core concepts in Atomic Habits is to focus on the small improvement. The impact a 1% improvement per day can make may appear negligible at first, but Clear makes a compelling argument that in the case of habits, thinking small produces the biggest results over time. ""Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement,"" explains Clear. Over the months and years, the accumulated effect of small habitual daily behaviors is staggering. Early in the book we are also warned that this compounding works both ways, so we'd better make sure we're making it work in the positive direction, not for the negative. This is a concept I was introduced to years ago under a different name - Kaizen - the Japanese term for continuous incremental improvement. What's different and new in this book is how the concept is applied specifically to building habits. I found the information introduced in chapter two about behavior change at the identity level to be spot-on. You're also given a simple two-step process for changing your identity and this one idea alone is incredibly powerful. In chapter three, we are introduced to the habit loop - cue, craving, response, reward - and we learn how to build good habits in 4 simple steps and break bad habits in 4 simple steps. One of those steps to habit formation, which goes hand in hand with the 1% concept, is how to make it not only small, but easy. In the chapters that follow, this is exactly what you find out. Other ideas of great value that stood out included, habit stacking (the best way to form a new habit), habit tracking, habit shaping and how to design your environment - physical and social - for habit building success. You learn the truth about self-control, how to stop procrastinating and how to use implementation intentions, temptation bundling and motivational rituals. The book is simply packed with actionable ideas, tactics and strategies. Virtually every idea in the book is useful and resonated with me. While I may not agree that we should ""forget about goals,"" I agree with one of Clear's core principles in the book - that we must develop systems for change. If we only focus on goals and don't develop systems and a focus on the process, we risk falling into a number of goal-related traps which ultimately lead to stagnation. With the right systems, we're rewarded with continuous improvement on a lifelong journey of success. Another difference between Atomic Habits and other books in this genre is that while it's based on science it doesn't bog you down with unnecessary details of the research. Clear's book is intensely practical, giving you a huge toolkit of organized and named strategies you can apply immediately to create and strengthen positive habits and stop the negative ones. The book is conversational, and includes many interesting stories, making it easy to read - and hard to put down (I read it cover to cover in one day). It's possible this might become your most highlighted personal improvement book because every page is so chocked full of memorable and quotable gems of advice.

344,5.0 out of 5 stars Walking Toward Good Habits: One Step at a Time,"Atomic Habits is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. Every page I learned something new, or a new way to think about something. There are many instances when I read a sentence and then thought to myself “Wow, I have never thought of that in that way.”  I also found myself guilty of a lot of bad habits. For example: I get an impulse to clean my room and I clean it. It stays clean for 2-3 days and then it goes back to being messy. Clear describes this as “treat[ing] the symptom without addressing the cause.” If you don’t make it a habit to clean your room, it will become messy again and will remain dirty until another burst of energy makes you decide to clean it again. It would be easier if you just made a habit of cleaning your room every day, so you don’t need a burst of energy to clean your room and use your energy for something else in your life. I really think this book is great for all ages. I am eighteen and I learned a lot of things that I could apply to my life and how I can change some of my habits. I think someone 20 or even 60 years older than me can learn a lot from this book because everyone wants to change some of their habits and want to learn better ways on how they can stick to their goals. The format of the book makes it an easy and pleasurable read. I like how most of the chapters start off with a story of a specific person that corresponds with the topic of that chapter.  Also, the real life examples of an everyday average person really helps this book make sense to the average person and makes it easier for people to relate to the topics talked about. I also thought the habit cheat sheets were extremely useful and a great way to capture what was talked about in the chapter. I also think someone could copy one of those cheat sheets for their own goal and put it on their own desk computer, refrigerator, or bathroom mirror. It would definitely be an easy way to remember your habit goals if it was right in front of you reminding you what to do. There are a couple strategies to make good habits that I am going to try to apply to my own life. For example: I really liked the idea of having a buddy or partner change all your passwords to social media for the weekdays. I feel like it creates so much free time to explore or find new things when you do not have a choice to go on social media when you are bored.  I thought it was a great way to limit you from going on social media during the weekdays. Also, after you stop having someone change your passwords, it creates a habit of not going on your phone so much because you are not used to it anymore. I think this is a really good habit that a lot of young people should try out because teenagers usually can’t separate from their phone and social media very easily. Another habit that I found very interesting was about the business man who moves a paperclip to a separate bowl every time he made a sales call and would not stop until all 120 paperclips were moved to the other bowl. I couldn’t believe how much that paper clip strategy helped his productivity. It was amazing to see such a small change to his work day (or a small habit) made such a huge difference for his entire life. I would strongly recommend this book to any person of any age. I believe this book can really teach many different people from different backgrounds a lot about how to develop good habits, but also learn how to get rid of the bad habits. Lastly, I think the author did a great job of motivating people in this book. He calls people out for being lazy if they are on their phone for more than 20 minutes scrolling through social media, but then he gives tips on how to change that bad habit. I remember reading that the average person spends 2 hour on their phone per day. That is over 700 hours per year spent on your phone. I found that statistic very powerful! I would rate this book a 5/5 stars and would definitely recommend taking the time to read it!

346,4.0 out of 5 stars Includes author's story for writing this book,"It was a nice surprise to read about the reason behind the writing of this book. Another refreshing aspect is that the book covers how habits are formed, whether good or bad and how to keep the good ones. As is my custom, when reading most books, is to read through the table of contents. When I came upon chapter 20 titled ""The Downside of Creating of Creating Good Habits"". So that's where I started but certainly not where I finished. Although I'm only at the beginning of chapter 4, entitled ""The Man Who Didn't Look Right"", I'm finding it a very interesting and helpful read. Atomic Habits consists of 306 pages which includes the index. Another interesting aspect of this book is the Notes section. It contains a detailed list of notes, references and citations towards the back that covers each chapter. Would I recommend this book. Yes and no. This should not be considered a quick read. It's a book that takes time to imbibe and practice otherwise, why bother. I bought the book because of a friend's recommendation. I needed something more in changing my eating habits. To be certain, this isn't a diet book but rather an explicit way in going from bad habits to good ones. As I once heard, life's a journey because a trip is too short. The only reason I gave it a four star rating is because I prefer hardback books without dust jackets. They only serve to getting in the way. I do read them but then off to the trash they go.

348,,"All too often the advice given to people is of the order: 'To a depressed person - ""Just Cheer Up"".'  Or perhaps to a person trying to lose weight, ""Eat less and move more"".  While ultimately correct, has no real benefit to the person hearing or reading the advice. Atomic Habits is exactly the opposite.  It provides many different ways to create those habits within you.  When I bought the book about this time last year, it was supposed to be a Christmas present to myself - one gift among the clutter (isn't that the correct collective noun for Christmas gifts?) just to surprise everyone else, i.e. Santa does make deliveries to adults.  Anyway . . . I opened the book during the holidays and could not find that lump of time to read it.  Skimming through the book I got one essential point.  Reading a book in one lump might not work so well for people, but could you find 15 minutes every morning to do this?  At this moment in time, that made all the sense in the world to me.  I simply can not find the time to read the book in a lump or two.  This is actually something that has worked against me for years.  It has limited my progress and my development for the past decade.  I do read quickly and on occasion will find that lump of time, but nothing like the 15 minutes every morning.  That 15 minutes is the time it takes to boil water for my pour-over coffee maker.  I do cheat a little here because I could get my coffee in about 11 or 12 minutes, but let's run with this habit creation. Starting January 2, 2023, the book was completed by the end of the month.  Doing the mathematics on this, I found 29 days with 1/4 of an hour each day.  This works out to over 7 hours of reading.  That was my first read, and I shared this with a friend.  We work together on a political executive.  Like the ""Walking Dead"", he changed too.  Looking at people who have not read or acquired the skills of Atomic Habits, is much like seeing a person from Mars with two heads.  There is an oddity to blaming the lack of time. Everyone reading this book will from the same common point develop their own habits, and develop along their own path, but it will not be for lack of time.  Realize what I said, you will never be able to say that there is insufficient time. Here is another example of what happened to me during the past year.  I drive 33 minutes to see a dear friend.  I treasure the time we have discussing things for he generates ideas and helps me generate those ideas.  He does not really know how very important he is to me.  But, I then need to drive 33 minutes back.  In that hour, I listen to an Audible title - it is a new habit.  My obvious caveat here is that the route I take is rather mundane and there are few traffic lights and the posted speeds are not that fast.  It is a pleasant drive and now a productive one. So, keeping up with these two habits, let's see how much reading I get done now? Waiting for coffee time:  0.25 hours x 365 = 91 hours of reading! Driving to my buddy's 60 minutes x 50 = 50 hours or reading !! The total amount of reading is now 140 hours of reading in one year.  Just those two atomic habits, and on average that could mean 28 books per year if I need 5 hours per book, but only 14 books if I read at the other end of average which is 10 hours per book.  On average, a good approximate FOR YOU MIGHT  be 7.5 hours per book and therefore 21 books per year. If you have read my review this far, congratulations!  You have exactly what it takes to master this one Atomic Habit and become a much better (I don't mean moral) person.  Buy the book!  Read it in manageable chunks as I suggested.  Get Audible (no!  I do not work for Amazon) to find those times when you have wasted chunks of time. Buy the book and make a positive difference in yourself.  Let that difference infect others (there is that Walking Dead theme again) and together make a difference in your lives and your world. Leo Oja, M.Ed. Read more",02 Dec 2023,L. J.

353,"5.0 out of 5 stars Thrilling, captivating, heartbreaking","I read this book in 3 days. I can hardly remember reading anything so quickly. The story and characters are so well described that you feel like you’re there with them in every minute. Part One feels like watching a war movie, gruesome and terrifying but honest and sacred. Part two was a little more difficult to read as I felt like it became a bit of a soap opera. You can’t possibly imagine more drama but then it comes. Somehow I guessed the ending, which I’ve never been able to do but it was still beautiful and so well written that I didn’t care. I’d definitely recommend! I just got back into reading again this year and I’m so glad I found Kristin Hannah’s books!

354,5.0 out of 5 stars Real. Honest. Heartbreaking.,"The Women hurt me in all of the best ways. This was my first book by Kristin Hannah, and it will certainly not be my last. Her storytelling is beautiful, effectively capturing all of each character's emotions and sending those feelings straight into your heart. I had to put this book down and take breaks because it made me so emotional, though I enjoyed it very much. It is a top read of 2024, for me. Frankie's naïveté in the beginning makes her a bit awkward, wholly unprepared for what's to come. I enjoyed getting to know her through the events and moments she experienced with Barb, Ethel, Jamie, and everyone she meets. Every place she visits. Everyone she helps. Everyone she saves. The traumatic effects of war on Frankie both in and after Vietnam cannot be understated. We navigate grief, fear, rejection, heartbreak, ignorance, betrayal, and so much more with her, seeing the consequences not only of the decisions she makes, but the ones that were made for her. Through each hurt and every trouble, after all she survives, there's a considerable difference in the woman she was and the woman she becomes, and that woman is an embodiment of resilience. Understanding the reality of what women faced with their military service, the critical roles they played, is so important, and I think Kristin Hannah, while writing a fictional story, highlighted them with care.

A detailed, emotional journey from sheltered idealism through a horrific reality, reminding all of us of a turbulent time in American history.  Brilliantly researched with great character development, but I found some repetitive sections, especially the multiple protest scenes that didn't seem to have as much impact on her choices ,  short of the full five star review.

356,"5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely amazing! An easily, well deserved 5 star read!","Kristin Hannah is back, baby!!! In a world where The Nightingale is numero uno I am here to tell you The Women gives it a run for its money! What an emotional rollercoaster ride! In true Hannah fashion, she rips your heart apart and mends it back together but with this one she did it to me several times. In a span of two pages, mine was pieced together just to be shattered again. But the ending. Oh my goodness. That ending. 🥺❤️ Historical fiction has always been a favorite of mine, but the last year or so I haven't really focused on it. I knew when I saw this book releasing I was going to read it and with the high praise I saw right off the bat even before its release, I had a feeling I, too, was going to love it. But I also was hesitant, because Historical Fiction hasn't been my go to lately. It can seem daunting to me at times. They are usually based on true stories and real people, so you know it is going to be an emotional ride. You just don't know if you are ready to embark on that journey or not. If you know what I am talking about or have felt similar, I am here to tell you, do not let that hold you back on reading this book! This book has the emotions of a romance novel, the edge of your seat tension like a thriller, and it is an absolutely must read for everyone! Please don't let this one pass you by. Even if historical fiction is not your normal go to genre, I promise this one is worth it! Hannah's writing is something magical. You are immediately hooked and transported to this world she has created on page one. In our world of reading books, there are good writers, there are bad writers, and then there are phenomenal writers. And Kristin Hannah, my friends, is a phenomenal writer!! When you read her books, you are seeing the words play out inside your head so easily, you feel like you are watching a movie. She is cinematic and that is how I know this book is going to translate so well to screen. How can it not with the foundation she has provided them?? (Yes, Warner Bros. has picked this up for a film! 🙌) So many HF novels focus on WWII. I love those books just as much as the next person, but it is so refreshing to get a different time period, especially from a queen like Hannah. I know nothing of the Vietnam War. I do remember seeing footage of how some people reacted and their opinions of the war, but not to the depths this book takes you on. Or how women were treated that were veterans in this war. That was eye-opening and heart wrenching, but sadly not surprising. Yes, this felt personally for me. As a nurse and a former ICU nurse, I love when we get a protagonist that is also in my field. But this book gutted me and made it feel like Hannah personally dug deep into my soul and stirred up feelings I had buried down deep with this one. I was wrecked. Like sitting in a Mexican restaurant with people all around with tears streaming down my face wrecked while reading this book. I can't tell you the last time a book emotionally wrecked me like this one did. Now I am not saying everyone will have that visceral reaction. In fact most probably won't,  but I am just telling you that is the response this book got from me. 😅 As usual, I went in blind not knowing what this book was about. I saw high praise and great feedback so I was excited, but like I said earlier I wasn't expecting this response from reading it. If you'd like to know a short synopsis of the book, it centers around a combat nurse, Frankie, who as recently graduated from nursing school, and despite her parents' protests and disappointment she has joined the Army to assist as a combat nurse in the Vietnam War. You watch Frankie transform from a naive, young girl who is in way over her head into a straight rockstar and that is something I think everyone in our field can relate to despite all of us not being in a similar predicament she is in. It is divided into two parts. Frankie's experience during the war and when she comes home. That was another unique take that I appreciated from the author. So many books stay in the combat part of war. Rarely have I read one where you go with the protagonist when they come back home and deal with the ""After"" part. There are some triggers, so if you want to know more about those feel free to reach out! I've never read a book centered around the Vietnam War, so I am extremely grateful Hannah chose this time period to write this amazing novel. And if you haven't gathered it already, I highly recommend this book for everyone. You are simply doing yourself a disservice if you skip over it. Period. **Also fun fact and as if i couldn't love this book anymore, my name made an appearance in the book. Granted it was spelled different (Celine), but it was still a pleasant surprise. ☺️ Read more",10 Feb 2024,Celene,5.0,B0C1X97LW7,"https://www.amazon.com/Women-Novel-Kristin-Hannah-ebook/dp/B0C1X97LW7/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

363,5.0 out of 5 stars Jonathan Haidt's The Anxious Generation Sparks Urgent Reflection and Action,"Jonathan Haidt's The Anxious Generation is, simply put, one of the most important and vital works of nonfiction I've read, and—quite possibly—the most influential book on my wife and I's parenting style and approach to technology. The Anxious Generation is bombshell after bombshell detonating all of our preconceived assumptions about social media, Gen Z, parenting, ""safetyism,"" mobile phones, childhood, education, and mental health. You've probably long suspected some of Haidt's observations and conclusions, but to see them put to words—and backed by heaps and heaps of research, neuroscience, philosophy, and spiritual musings—is to have your assumptions about what we consider ""normal"" rocked to its very core. I'm so thankful I read this book prior to the birth of my daughter. This is a book I want to put into the hands of every parent, want-to-be parent, teacher, politician, tech CEO, or anyone who works/engages with children and/or cares about the collective mental health of our country. I firmly believe that if enough people—especially parents of young children—read this book, it could change the trajectory of our nation's approach to technology and childhood. In short, Haidt's argument boils down to one salient point: We've overprotected our children from the real world, and underprotected them from the virtual world.. He advocates for a return to the ""play-based childhood,"" and points the transition to the ""phone-based childhood"" as the primary driver of a significant increase in anxiety, depression, and self-harm among teenagers—especially teenage girls. Additionally, because of culture's perpetual fear-based approach to child-rearing, we've left our kids woefully unprepared for the pressures of the ""real world""—and points to evidence of the startling number of Gen Zers and younger Millennials who appears trapped in a state of perpetual young adulthood. The best aspect of The Anxious Generation is how easy it would've been for Haidt to just document a series of social ills and offer a diagnosis. But the back half of this book is full of extremely practical steps, application points, and ""rules"" for ensuring your children don't have their neurobiology hacked by tech companies who only want to monopolize their attention—mental health consequences be damned. And, even though the harms hone in on Gen Z and younger Millennials, I find myself often convicted of my own habitual phone use throughout the course of this book and I realize even I didn't escape unscathed. Read this book. Buy a hard copy and highlight it. I want to give a copy to all of my friends, young parents, and teachers. And not just because I want to discuss this book—but, because as Haidt points out over and over again, this is a cultural issue that requires mass collective action in order to change. So, the more people who read this book and are startled awake by its findings, then the easier it'll be to implement the changes Haidt recommends.

364,"4.0 out of 5 stars Impressive, Valuable, If Somewhat Repetitive","At breakfast with a member of our local Board of Ed, I asked what is behind the growth industry of psychologists, psychiatrists, and counselors in our (and all) school districts.  I asked why we unquestioningly welcome the increase in the number of troubled students and wanted to know the root cause of all this malaise. He replied ""Social media on mobile phones.""  Then he told me about this book. Haidt appears to be at the cutting edge of diagnosing the social, emotional, and physical effects of social media.  Right up front, he outlines the topics he will tackle in this book and how he will propose to help solve the problems.  And he does:  His book is full of data and is perfectly convincing.  My observation is that he could achieve all his goals more effectively with less repetition, side dalliances, and bloat.  One gets the message much sooner and more often than the book demands. Still!  If you recall the big move to delay school start times in the morning because the data supported the benefits, you should make an appointment with the Superintendent, as I have, to ask what they intend to do about the damage caused by the carpet bombing of developing minds by empty - and emptying - social media.

365,"5.0 out of 5 stars Kids need to be social, not on social media","After finishing Jonathan Haidt’s The Anxious Generation, I couldn’t wait to recommend it to my family, friends, and others. I truly believe this book is a must-read for anyone with a smartphone, children, or, well, a pulse. Smartphones’ impact has been so fast and pervasive in our culture that we are only beginning to understand how they are changing us. Because of that, The Anxious Generation is one of the most important nonfiction books I have read this year, perhaps in several years. While many have expressed concern about the impact of mobile phones and social media on our youth, Haidt has made it his mission to uncover the symptoms, explain the effects, and convince us to change how we raise our kids regarding phones and social media. The insights provided in The Anxious Generation make a compelling case for reevaluating the age at which we give our children phones, the extent of their Internet and social media access, and the value of free play. Haidt argues that smartphones, social media, and helicopter parenting have contributed to a decline in the mental well-being of young people. The book offers practical solutions crucial for fostering the emotional maturity and stability of our children and ourselves. At the book’s center are four cultural norms Haidt argues we must implement to address the mental health crisis among our youth. These norms serve as a framework for his argument and practical solutions. First, no smartphones before high school. Parents should delay children’s entry into round-the-clock internet access by giving them only basic phones (phones with limited apps and no internet browser) before ninth grade (roughly 14). Second, no social media before 16. Let kids get through the most vulnerable period of brain development before connecting them to a constant stream of social comparison and algorithmically chosen influencers, which can significantly impact their self-esteem and mental health. Next, phone-free schools. All elementary through high school, students should store their phones, smartwatches, and other personal devices to send or receive texts in phone lockers or locked pouches during the school day. This policy is crucial in creating a distraction-free environment that allows students to focus on their studies and social interactions. And, last,  far more unsupervised play and childhood independence. That’s the way children naturally develop social skills, overcome anxiety, and become self-governing young adults. Some money quotes? “My central claim in this book is that these two trends—overprotection in the real world and underprotection in the virtual world—are the major reasons why children born after 1995 became the anxious generation.” “People don’t get depressed when they face threats collectively; they get depressed when they feel isolated, lonely, or useless.” “The two big mistakes we’ve made: overprotecting children in the real world (where they need to learn from vast amounts of direct experience) and underprotecting them online (where they are particularly vulnerable during puberty).” “While the reward-seeking parts of the brain mature earlier, the frontal cortex—essential for self-control, delay of gratification, and resistance to temptation—is not up to full capacity until the mid-20s, and preteens are at a particularly vulnerable point in development” “In this new phone-based childhood, free play, attunement, and local models for social learning are replaced by screen time, asynchronous interaction, and influencers chosen by algorithms. Children are, in a sense, deprived of childhood.” “We don’t let preteens buy tobacco or alcohol, or enter casinos. The costs of using social media, in particular, are high for adolescents, compared with adults, while the benefits are minimal. Let children grow up on Earth first, before sending them to Mars.” “Stress wood is a perfect metaphor for children, who also need to experience frequent stressors in order to become strong adults.” “Children can only learn how to not get hurt in situations where it is possible to get hurt, such as wrestling with a friend, having a pretend sword fight, or negotiating with another child to enjoy a seesaw when a failed negotiation can lead to pain in one’s posterior, as well as embarrassment. When parents, teachers, and coaches get involved, it becomes less free, less playful, and less beneficial. Adults usually can’t stop themselves from directing and protecting.” “By designing a firehose of addictive content that entered through kids’ eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person socializing, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human development on an almost unimaginable scale.” “Gen Z became the first generation in history to go through puberty with a portal in their pockets that called them away from the people nearby and into an alternative universe that was exciting, addictive, unstable, and—as I will show—unsuitable for children and adolescents.” “Over the course of many decades, we found ways to protect children while mostly allowing adults to do what they want. Then quite suddenly, we created a virtual world where adults could indulge any momentary whim, but children were left nearly defenseless. As evidence mounts that phone-based childhood is making our children mentally unhealthy, socially isolated, and deeply unhappy, are we okay with that trade-off? Or will we eventually realize, as we did in the 20th century, that we sometimes need to protect children from harm even when it inconveniences adults?” “We are embodied creatures; children should learn how to manage their bodies in the physical world before they start spending large amounts of time in the virtual world.” “One way that companies get more users is by failing to enforce their own rules prohibiting users under 13. In August 2019, I had a video call with Mark Zuckerberg, who, to his credit, was reaching out to a wide variety of people, including critics. I told him that when my children started middle school, they each said that most of the kids in their class (who were 10 or 11 at the start of sixth grade) had Instagram accounts. I asked Zuckerberg what he planned to do about that. He said, “But we don’t allow anyone under 13 to open an account.” I told him that before our call I had created a fake account for a fictional 13-year-old girl and I encountered no attempt to verify my age claim. He said, “We’re working on that.” While writing this chapter (in August 2023), I effortlessly created another fake account. There is still no age verification, even though age verification techniques have gotten much better in the last four years nor is there any disincentive for preteens to lie about their age.” “Our kids can do so much more than we let them. Our culture of fear has kept this truth from us. They are like racehorses stuck in the stable.” “Many of the best adventures are going to happen with other children in free play. “And when that play includes kids of mixed ages, the learning is deepened because children learn best by trying something that is just a little beyond their current abilities— in other words, something a slightly older kid is doing. Older kids can also benefit from interacting with younger kids, taking on the role of a teacher or older sibling. So, the best thing you can do for your young children is to give them plenty of playtime, with some age diversity, and a secure loving base from which they set off to play. “As for your own interactions with your child, they don’t have to be “optimized.” You don’t have to make every second special or educational. “It’s a relationship, not a class. But what you do often matters far more than what you say, so watch your own phone habits. Be a good role model who is not giving continuous partial attention to both the phone and the child.” Read more",04 Jul 2024,Daniel Burton,5.0,0593655036,https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Generation-Rewiring-Childhood-Epidemic/dp/0593655036/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

373,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredibly moving,"If you’re not in tears by the end of this book, then you’re made of sterner stuff than I. If you’re feeling fragile, it’s probably not the best thing to read right now. Having said that, it’s a beautifully written story with a strong thread of mothers and daughters throughout. My mom loved Elvis, and I grew up with his music in our house, plus all the books about him, so in a way, I felt like I was reading “From Here to the Great Unknown” for my mom because she’s no longer here to read it herself. I did have a few issues with the book—for instance, almost nothing is said about Scientology (Lisa Marie left the church, and as her son Ben said before he died, “that religion messes kids up”). [fwiw, I don’t have strong opinions on it myself; I feel that *all* organized religions have significant downsides.] Also, there is very little said by Lisa Marie about her marriages—I mean, I would have liked to have known what she thought about Michael Jackson’s extreme surgeries (was it weird to her?) and what she thought about Nicolas Cage being a huge Elvis fan (did she feel like the ultimate collector’s item?). Nothing is said about the family’s involvement with the 2022 movie “Elvis.” What’s more, the book leaves out the custody battle Lisa Marie was fighting with the father of her twins at the time of her death, and also Priscilla’s lawsuit against her granddaughter for control of the Presley estate. But truly, this memoir isn’t so much about facts as it is about feelings and the human experience—and as such, it is successful. It’s one of the most moving books I have ever read.

Lisa's life, like most peoples - is filled with her & others around her doing some bad, neutral, good & morally questionable things.

As for everyone else I'll try not to reveal too much so that if you're interested it'll still be worth reading. PROS: Uniquely done with both Lisa and her daughter telling the story. Gritty, Humorous, Genuine All the things a person looks for in memoir. Whether you're a fan or just kind of curious it's worth a read or listen. Riley & Julia do a beautiful job on the audiobook. CONS: If subjects like assault, addiction and death are too much for you - don't read this. SHORT While I learned a lot of things I didn't know before & it is wonderfully told... it does kind of feel like a filled in highlight reel. ASSUMPTIONS It seems to assume that you've read/watched interviews that Lisa has given. EXAMPLE & MINOR SPOILERS Lisa has previously talked about how her marriage to Danny was always strained because he - a struggling musician- was always resentful of her fame & the fact that she had so much more money than him. In the book it doesn't touch on it that much but, it is brought up when she & MJ are starting to get close. If I hadn't read those interviews I would think that she just threw away Danny out of nowhere to hook up with Michael. SCIENTOLOGY Her unhappy break up with Scientology is not really mentioned at all. POSSIBLE CONS ? If you hate cursing this book is filled with it. The audiobook does have Lisa's voice but most of her words are said by Julia Roberts and as good as a job that Julia did I was a little disappointed to not hear Lisa narrate her parts. FINAL THOUGHTS A riveting read that feels a little too short. I understand wanting to keep some stories to yourself - but the book just felt like it needed... more. The  * Spoilers* around 6 year on and off again relationship with MJ alone could've been a book it's self. It feels like a lot was left out for legal - Lockwood and Scientology- reasons. It could have easily been 100 pages longer without feeling like it was dragging. Note: Lisa asked for help with this book because she didn't know what it should contain. And Riley probably wanted to finish this book before it turned into a ' I'll do it later' project that's placed on a to-do-list for years. So I understand it's shortness & missing info even though I don't like it. It was probably the best Riley could do with what she had. * I doubt you're reading this but I've been a fan of your mother for many years and though I've never met her, I believe she would be so proud of you for finishing her book. She clearly loved her babies so much.

375,5.0 out of 5 stars Painfully beautiful,"As someone who is grieving her mother who was also grieving her son my whole life, this book was beautiful. It’s not a American literature masterpiece but it’s real, straight to the point, and raw. It’s written as if Lisa Marie was talking. I’m surprised to say this because I didn’t expect the book to be grief focused but I believe anyone grieving could benefit from this book simply because it shows that grief is a universal feelings we all just deal with that emptiness differently. It made me feel normal for missing my mom the way I do and not so bad about the dumb decisions I made when I was younger. It made me realize the only way through this life is love. Grief is unconditional love with no where to go and how we process snd redirect that misplaced love can affect everything in our life. Grief never goes away, it doesn’t really get better we just keep moving. Thank you Riley for make sure this book was released. Lisa Marie reminded me a lot of my mom with her raw, gritty personality and even some childhood trauma they both faced. I read this book in one sitting and will read it again.

Riley has done a wonderful job honoring her beloved Mother by getting Lisa Marie's heartbreaking truth.  A brilliant view into Lisa Marie's quite sad life.  Lisa thought that the only person who ever loved her (besides her children) was her beloved Daddy.  This book is not exactly a positive portrayal of Priscilla, but it is the truth.  Read this book.  Be ready to cry, laugh and discover the true life of a strong, loving, brilliant woman that was Lisa Marie.  Riley Keough has done a love letter to her Mom and it is from the heart.  God bless Lisa Marie, Elvis, the Keough family, Harper and Finley.  A brilliant discovery of Lisa Marie's life.  I love this book.

382,"5.0 out of 5 stars Provocative, empathetic, and masterfully-written","Ta-Nehisi Coates writes this book in a deeply personal way that is both empathetic, lyrical, and insightful. His curiosity takes him on three journeys. In his first journey, he visits Dakar, Senegal on his first trip to Africa — or the ""Last Stop,"" as he calls it, before his enslaved ancestors were shipped off to the New World. One of the most poignant parts is when he's in Dakar and realizes he is ""seeking out the solace of [his own] self-reflection."" In other words, he is visiting the ""ghosts"" of his ancestors and not seeing the actual people who are there now. It's a solipsistic admission but it's powerful. In his journey to North Carolina, Coates is visiting a teacher activist who is trying to teach his book. She's willing to risk her job to keep his book as part of her curriculum and not have it banned. In the final journey, he visits Occupied Palestine and Israel. With empathy, he explores navigates the emotional terrain of Yad Vashem. He also witnesses the Israeli apartheid system first-hand. He asks questions. His curiosity and conscience help him to grapple with the cognitive dissonance of the harsh reality he sees Palestinians living against the stories he'd blindly accepted prior to visiting.

383,5.0 out of 5 stars Coates Unveils Parallels Between American Racism and Palestinian Struggles,"Coates’s latest work is a powerful exploration of historical and ongoing injustices, drawing parallels between racial oppression in America and in Israeli, which has come to a boil in the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His narrative challenges readers to confront uncomfortable truths and question long-held beliefs. Through his lens as a Black American, Coates provides a unique perspective on power dynamics and systemic racism. His writing is both profound and unsettling, urging readers to acknowledge past and present racialized violence and seek universal justice. While some may find his analysis provocative, Coates's commitment to truth-telling is both courageous and necessary. Unfortunately, some critics have resorted to unfairly attacking Coates's character in an attempt to discredit him, largely due to their discomfort with the truths he presents. Ironically, these disingenuous critiques only serve to prove his point, highlighting how the darkest times in America still resonate worldwide. The parallels he draws are not just historical—they are lived realities that persist today, underscoring the urgency of his message for justice and equality. As Benjamin Franklin wisely noted, ""Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as those who are."" Coates's work shines a light on injustices that reverberate through our society, urging us all to share in the outrage and demand change. His exploration of these issues is not just a call for awareness but a rallying cry for collective action towards justice and equality.

384,5.0 out of 5 stars Hauntingly Exquisite & Wise,"I had forgotten how amazing and powerful Coates’ work is. This book was of particular interest to me because of some things I have in common with the author.  I lived in Baltimore during the decade of the 80’s not far from the neighborhood where Coates was growing up, and I have been to both Senegal and Palestine.  Like Coates, I traveled throughout Israel and Palestine, met many pro-Palestinian activists (Palestinian, Bedouin, and Israeli), and went to Yad Vashem and explored the old city of Jerusalem by myself. Coates’ reflections on these places feel like he tapped into my inchoate thoughts and feelings and turned them into achingly beautiful poetry. We are so very lucky to share time and space with this stellar talent who speaks truth to power in such exquisite prose.  George Orwell would be very proud.

389,,Writer Ta-Nehisi Coates adds to his sterling corpus this investigation of his “African” roots (a visit to Senegal) contrasting it with 10 days shared equally between Palestine and Israel coming to terms with the ugliness of the Zionist ethnic cleansing (the Naqba of 1948 and ever since) and the way in which Vad Yashem (?) acts as a kind of fig leaf cover for the crimes committed by Zionists against Palestinians. I admire and respect the way in which he interrogates himself and the things he admits missing in first sight. I am shocked yet also unsurprised in the US of these times that his clear sight is not welcome and his books suffer censorship by those who fear the revelations. This could easily be the book of the year 2024.

391,5.0 out of 5 stars Only book review I’ve ever written.,"This is an amazing memoir. I know next to nothing about Van Halen other than the 3 songs from 1984 that got radio play. But I read a blurb about this book, thought I’d check it out. I’m an avid reader, to put it mildly, and a former Language Arts teacher - and this was the one of the best memoirs I’ve ever read. Soooo many of them are far longer than they need to be, include too many details either foreign or boring to the reader, and serve as little more than a self celebration. This was none of those. Other than the sometimes annoying overuse of ! and HA!, the writing style was absolutely perfect. He took a lot of history, details, and information not known to many readers and crafted an accessible, very moving, and really fascinating tribute to his brother. Fans of the band will certainly love the book, but what elevates it is that even a reader such as I, who has only a passing knowledge of the group or the music industry, found myself unable to put it down - other than to repeatedly Google song names and guitar terms and watch of few of their videos for reference; I quickly realized that saying Eddie Van Halen was gifted and innovative is an understatement of some magnitude. Alex Van Halen clearly put a lot of love into writing this book. It has just the right amount of sentiment, detail, and “inside information” and his approach is often humorous and unfailingly charming. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. HA! 😄 Read more",26 Oct 2024,Barbara,5.0,0063265702,"https://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Alex-van-Halen/dp/0063265702/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

392,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Read!,"Life long Classic Van Halen fan (The Roth era), and this memoir is a quick, yet fascinating read. Loved the insight into Edward & Alex growing up, and the at odds parenting of their mother and Jan Van Halen. This book, along with the Noel Monk (band manager) book, are my favorites, thus far. I was disappointed in the Brad Tolinski ""Eruption"" book, only because it simply referenced all the older interviews he did with Guitar World, that i had read in the magazine, previously. The Steven Rosen book was good, but desperately needed an editor, because it is too long & repetitive.

393,4.0 out of 5 stars Definitely worth the read!,"Before purchasing this book I scanned some of the reviews and noted some of the negatives. Being a lifelong fan of VH I knew I would buy it anyway, but I was curious to see what the naysayers had to to say. I agree with some of the flack. The book is indeed short, a very quick read for a band that was around for decades and sold millions of albums and sold out huge concert venues. And as noted, the Sammy Hagar era is not touched on at all, even though they sold huge with Sammy on vocals. Alex Van Halen had his reasons for that, and that is for the man himself to say. But, as a guy who grew up listening to VH and loving every minute of it, it was a pleasure to read this book. Thank you Alex Van Halen for putting your memories and emotions down for all of us to soak in. I had  the pleasure of seeing them in concert a couple of times, with 3rd row seats at one of the concerts - a personal highlight for sure. I would have given this book 5 stars if it was longer and included at least a little of the Hagar period. But, as said, Al had his reasons. If your a fan and want an easy read that gives you a look inside the life of the Van Halen brothers and their music, buy this book.  Also, if you're interested in  Eddie Van Halen's take on things look for the YouTube clip of his interview at the Smithsonian.  Once you start watching it, you won't be able to stop!  Thanks again Alex Van Halen for all the memories!

394,5.0 out of 5 stars Worth The Read !!,"“BROTHERS” By Alex Van Halen When I heard that Alex Van Halen was writing a book, I could not wait to read it, for many reasons, but of course the number one reason was because I missed Edward Van Halen so damn much and still to this day can’t accept that he’s gone. Come to find out, neither can Alex. And I know that I’m not alone in this feeling. To me, he wasn’t what some people, ( Ok, A lot of people), would call their hero, because I believe that the word hero should be reserved for the real, actual heroes in the world, and that it gets thrown around, mixed in and mixed up incorrectly and creates a false answer to the question, What Is A hero. A War Hero?  Someone that’s saving lives… giving up their own life or at least putting themselves into the line of fire to save others… Absolutely – HERO! Sports Hero?  Guitar Hero?? Well, I won’t continue this because it’s really a matter of opinion, but I would rather use the words sports legend rather than sports hero and a Guitar Player, no matter how great, is a rock star. My point is to say that Eddie Van Halen was a big part of my life. Musical inspiration of the highest caliper. He was born 10-1/2 years before me and passed away in 2020, just over 4 years ago at age 65. I had his influence in my life from age 13 until 55! Pretty significant I’d say. When Van Halen 1 was released in FEB. 1978, I was all of 13. A brand-new teenager in the 8th grade. I had started playing the drums, ( well, the snare drum first because I had to prove to my Musician Father that I was serious and could/would learn to read and study the material through lessons)  when I was in 5th grade, which puts me at about 10 years old when I first held the drums sticks and started studying. I didn’t get an actual drum set until the 7th grade and the only reason that I got that drum set that my parents could never afford, was because my brother died and had left Mom some money. So, it was a sad/happy feeling to have received those drums under that circumstance, so you’d damn well better know that I took it all very seriously! I’ve always taken Music seriously and that’s why I refuse to tolerate others that don’t. NO, it’s NOT just a hobby! Dad was an actual Musician, a real life long Musician, so I had a teacher living in my house with me ( Ha Ha ). This was both beneficial and a huge pain in the butt!  When I was 10, he was 58! Dad ruled with an iron fist! Two of them in fact. So, If I ever didn’t pay attention at a lesson, or had a question for dear ole Dad…  “What do you mean you don’t understand what the teacher told you!? What the hell am I paying for?  Why weren’t you paying attention! You don’t know the value of a dollar! Ahhhh… Fun Fun Fun - Practice, Practice, Practice - Love It, Love It, Love It. Even though my instrument of choice at the time was the drums and Eddie Van Halen is obviously a guitarist, Eddie wrote all the music. Not the lyrics, not the drum parts, but all the music. I loved their Music. It motivated me and it moved me in ways that I had never felt as a kid, or even a young adult. Growing up, I always heard the Drummer jokes – A band of 4 consists of 3 musicians and a drummer … Ha Ha … But upon reading this book by Alex, I learned that they treated each other as equals, and Alex had a say in the music as to the form, the structure, intros, fade in and outs, song choices, song order, and all those things because they respected each other and had a very tight brotherly bond through all the years together before they made it. And they stuck together through it all even after they made it. I was hoping that this book would be mostly about Eddie, even though I like to think that as far as Eddie Van Halen goes, I’ve read every interview in print and have seen every interview on video! The difference being that Alex was there and experienced everything that Ed did, plus, they were brothers, so I was hoping for a different take from another person that was there. I wanted a personal perspective from Eddie, I wanted to know what they talked about privately, and I wanted insight on how things really went down during the many events that they had during the Van Halen years, I wanted to be a fly on the wall when the two Brothers talked about “things and stuff”, not just what they told reporters and casual encounters with people that told stories. Well, I must report that after reading it all, if you were hoping for the same revelations for the same reasons I was, you’re going to be disappointed. But, the book itself isn’t disappointing at all, it’s a great read and I highly recommend it.  And he does reveal certain aspects of their lives together as they toured the world, but maybe I just had my expectations set too high. Understand that from my point of view, my point of expectations, my perspective, the book could have been ten thousand pages and reveled everything they’ve ever said and done, and it still wouldn’t have satisfied me. But, keep in mind, I’m me, and you’re normal! Apparently, he started writing it in 2020 right after he lost his brother, though I didn’t hear about him writing a book until sometime in 2023, maybe late 2022. But it still seemed like an awful long time after finding out, so, maybe that’s why I expected so much. Anticipation does that to you. This is why surprises are so memorable and effective. No time to over think things. The book starts out about their Parents and their struggles. It details how shy Eddie was, how sensitive he was and how he always hated giving interviews. It then gets into their club days playing dive bars and backyard parties. It details how they met Michael Anthony and David Lee Roth and there are some interesting details about their club days and especially DLR that are fun to read. They were the best of friends and did everything together for the greater good, which was the band! Their commitment, their comradery. The 4 of them stuck together through all the drama that they would face. Alex doesn’t hold anything back, which is a strong point in the book when reading his words, as he details emotions that both he and Ed felt about certain people and certain happenings. He really hammers it out about when DLR decided that Van Halen was all about him, and that DLR was the main attraction of Van Halen and decided to leave to pursue a solo career.  DLR didn’t even go to Eddie and Valeries Marriage Ceremony. The book doesn’t go into the Sammy Hagar years at all. It stops at their last record from the original line up which included David Lee Roth until 1984. Alex doesn’t say much about Ed’s condition and the years of sickness, other than a few mentions about how he’d always have a cigarette in his mouth, plus he’d have one burning in the ashtray, and he always had one in the strings of the headstock of his guitar – 3 at a time, all the time! He calls his brother self-destructive and blames his shyness at being called the greatest guitar player that ever lived and not knowing how to handle all that responsibility, much less having to constantly live up to it, thinking that he wasn’t worthy of his god given gift to play the guitar. Alex mentions how their mother died on the same day that his youngest son was born, and that Eddie died on the same day that his oldest son was born. Though it doesn’t state that they were all in the same years, I suspect he’s talking about the dates themselves, not the exact day AND year. The book is 227 pages and, it does give the details that a normal fan would want, so, other than my own over-expecting, it’s a great read and I highly recommend it if you grew up with Van Halen on the brain! ~~ Chris T. ~~ Read more",04 Nov 2024,Chris in Providence R.I.,5.0,0063265702,"https://www.amazon.com/Brothers-Alex-van-Halen/dp/0063265702/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

399,,"I was amazed when I heard Alex Van Halen was writing a book looking at his relationship with his brother in the context of his family and the band, Van Halen. To get something from who seems like a very private person was unexpected. If you are a die hard Van Halen fan then the book doesn't really provide any new stories. However, you get Alex's point of view on a lot of famous stories about the band. As well, his perspective of family life with Edward Van Halen and also the rise of Van Halen from the early days through 1984 (Alex stated in an interview that when Roth left the spiritual sense of Van Halen ended at that point - the original four members. Through reading this it is apparent that Alex was the pragmatic one of the group so I have to take his perspective as being the most honest. Being an active part of the band, yet, being able to observe the creative friction of DLR and EVH. What a seat to have! He draws from a number of other biographies that many VH fans may have read so not everything here is fresh material. Having said that, it helps bring various point of view of major players in the band (DLR, Ted Templeman, Noel Monk) together. On a side note, in the Coda, Alex mentions some social media posts from fans and prints them in the book. I can only imagine what it will be like should one of those fans read the book and see their words in print. Especially knowing they affected Alex in a positive way. Alex mentioned in interviews that the book was a way to try to deal with the grief of losing his brother. If it did in some way then I am happy for him although I know he still struggles with not having Edward around. If you are a Van Halen fan then add it to your book list because this is probably the  last inside look that matters.

402,5.0 out of 5 stars Bow Down to the Queen of YA Fantasy,"This book, with its magic, fairytale roots, and steamy hot romance, deserves ALL of the stars.  I loved it! Here are the five reasons why I gave A Court of Thorns and Roses 5 out of 5 stars (and then some): ★ FAIRYTALE RETELLING I was a little wary of this story when I discovered that it was a fairytale retelling.  I love the story of Beauty and the Beast.  Growing up, I watched the Disney version all of the time (but not as much as I watched Pocahontas).  However, in the past I have struggled to find enjoyment in Beauty and the Beast retellings.  Particularly Beastly by Alex Flinn -- I did not enjoy the book or the movie. I think I was worried that A Court of Thorns and Roses wouldn't feel original, but it was the complete opposite.  Maas has written an incredibly unique story that is grounded in the fairytale we all know and love, but is also independent and utter creative genius (Maas is definitely honing and owning her writing skills!).  Yes, there is a curse, and magic, and a love story.  But there is also dark magic, and steamy romance (and I do mean steamy!), and blood and gore, and court drama -- basically, all of my favorite things wrapped up in one neat, rose-colored bow. There were some twists on the original story of Beauty and the Beast that I really enjoyed.  For example, in the original story, the residents/servants of the Beast's home are cursed and transformed into household items.  However in ACOTAR, rather than being transformed into household items, Maas' cursed characters must wear masquerade masks, and have done so for 50 years since the curse was placed on the night of a masquerade party.  I also appreciated that, though Tamlin was a beast, that quality did not factor into the curse that was placed on him.  Rather, as a Fae, he has the power of shape-shifting, and takes the form of a beast (usually when fighting).  So, throughout most of the book, Tamlin is portrayed as a glorious, chiseled, man of steel.  Some readers believe that the fact that Tamlin is gorgeous retracts from the Beauty and the ""Beast"" story line.  However, no one writes hot male love interests like Sarah J. Maas, so I am not complaining about Tamlin at all. Overall, I found that I loved the fairytale background of this story more than anything.  I enjoyed drawing comparisons between Maas' story and characters, and the story I grew up with.  Maas' world is so intriguing, engrossing you from the very beginning and never letting you go. ★ GENRE While we know that ACOTAR is a fairytale retelling, that is not to say that it is a children's book.  I went into this book thinking that it was Young Adult.  However, there is a particular scene that takes place after the Great Rite on Fire Night (such a good scene, by the way -- just wait for it) that made me take a step back and think ""Whoa!  This is way too sexy and erotic for Young Adult literature."" Looking back at Goodreads, I found that the book was listed as Young Adult and New Adult.  But, I would personally classify this book as New Adult.  Having read many New Adult novels, I found that the sex rating for ACOTAR resonates with that of a New Adult novel.  I think that there is a lot of confusion about the genre of this book because we all know Sarah J. Maas as a Young Adult author.  I personally have no problem with this genre.  However, for parents who are giving this book to their young children, or for those readers who don't enjoy sex scenes in their books -- you have been warned. I love the New Adult genre, and discovering that ACOTAR fell into that genre made me love it even more.  I appreciate the more mature content, and that the characters are closer to my age (Feyre is 19).  And, hey, I appreciate the sexy times, too.  (There is no shame in my game...  Because, who am I kidding?  I have no game.)  I had also never read a New Adult Fantasy before, so I was glad to be exploring new territory. I'm absolutely impressed with Maas as a writer.  She is not afraid to be different, to venture out to new places.  I love that she is entering this new genre, and look forward to seeing what else she has up her sleeve for the future. ★ FEYRE, THE PROTAGONIST When I started reading ACOTAR, I was sure Maas was going to give us another Celaena Sardothien:  a badass girl who is nearly invincible, yet lovable and cool.  However, Feye (pronounced Fay-ruh) is so different from other fantasy protagonists I have read, because she is so unapologetically human.  She is normal, and she is flawed, and I found that I could easily relate to her character.  Feyre is unlike the female protagonists we are accustomed to.  She is no fighter, not outstandingly gorgeous, and she is also illiterate (a shortcoming that embarrasses her to not end). In the beginning, Feyre is not very likable.  She is cold, harsh, stubborn, and hard-headed.  But, readers begin to see how her situation of poverty has shaped her to be that way.  Once at the Spring Court, where she is no longer burdened with the responsibility of taking care of her father and two sisters (all of whom are ungrateful of her efforts to keep them alive), the ice in her heart begins to melt as she lives in comfort and takes up her passion for painting.  Readers witness her character develop as she begins to rediscover happiness and life's simple pleasures.  Feyre easily becomes a character you can't help but root for and love. ★ TAMLIN & AN IMPENDING LOVE TRIANGLE Since we have discussed Feyre, I believe that it is only appropriate to take a glance at her love interest: Tamlin. Tamlin is a bae Fae warrior, with magical abilities.  He is also gorgeous, kind-hearted, and strong.  And, he places Feyre's happiness and well-being above all else.  But, he is not perfect.  He is flawed, haunted by his family's past, by his own mistakes, and the lives he has taken.  But, through all of that, he still strives to do and be good. However, I admit that while I love Tamlin, I am worried that Maas has a love triangle in the works for Book 2 of ACOTAR. Because Rhysand. Rhys, a sexy, dangerous Fae, is a force of nature who seeks to dig his claws (or rather, talons) into Feyre.  And, I can't say that I hate him.  I actually like his character, although we witness him do some terrible things (even to Feyre).  He seems edgy, fun, and is incredibly witty.  (Maas does this thing where she makes you fall in love with all of her characters, even the morally ambiguous ones.)  While Tamlin is all gorgeous and good, Rhys has that hot-but-tragic thing going for him. I am already struggling with the love square Maas has going on in the Throne of Glass series (between Celaena and her three love interests -- Chaol, Dorian, and Rowan).  I don't think that I will be able to handle the emotional roller coaster of another of her love triangles.  But, I think that as long as no one else is introduced, as long as this does not move into the quadrilateral stage, everything will be fine. ★ SUPPORTING CHARACTERS While Maas' main characters are at the center of attention, her supporting characters keep this book afloat.  With less focus and fewer appearances, Maas' supporting characters still manage to steal our hearts and the show. First, there is Lucien, the red-haired, one-eyed Fae who is Tamlin's best friend.  He is initially rude to Feyre, but eventually warms up to her.  They easily develop a sort of big-brother-little-sister relationship.  I would consider Lucien to be the story's comic relief.  He is humorous and sarcastic and I adore his character. There is also Amarantha, the story's evil villainess.  She is a Fae ruler who has a particular hatred for humans, which is not good for Feyre.  She is cold, calculating, and cruel.  But she has a backstory (all the best villains have backstories).  And, I don't want to spoil you all, so I will just say that, when you learn her backstory, you realize why Amarantha is so harsh and unforgiving.  Although, while I can sympathize with her on some level,  I find her evil ways to be too much at times.  However, I still find her to be an interesting, well-written character. And of course, there is Rhysand, whom I mentioned earlier.  He is incredibly important to the story of Book 1, and will have an even larger presence in Book 2.  I cannot wait to learn more about his character, because he is so enigmatic and intriguing and I just know that I am going to love him. HONORABLE MENTIONS Maas' Writing I believe that ACOTAR is Maas' at her best.  As I stated earlier, we are definitely seeing Maas hone and perfect her skill -- each book she releases is always better than the last.  What I liked most about Maas' writing in ACOTAR was her use of first person.  Throne of Glass is written in third person, and with changing character perspectives.  I find that I can tend to get bored with certain characters.  But, with ACOTAR, told from Feyre's perspective, I felt engaged throughout the entire book. Faerie World I literally want to live in Prythian, in the world of the Fae that exists beyond The Wall (just without all of the drama).  Maas depicts the Spring Court so beautifully and vividly.  It seems like a literal heaven on earth. Other than the beauty of the Fae world, there are the parties and festivities.  I mentioned Fire Night and the Great Rite earlier, two very interesting festivities held in the Fae world.  And then there are parties and gatherings celebrating the seasons, such as Summer Solstice and Midsummer.  It is all so fantastical and fun, readers are just dying to step into the pages. *** There is not much else I can say about A Court of Thorns and Roses.  I LOVED this book!  I have no idea how I am going to wait an entire year for the sequel.  It's going to be excruciating, but I am sure that it is going to worth it.  Because Sarah J. Maas is a fabulous queen of writing, and every word she writes turns to gold.

403,5.0 out of 5 stars A Captivating Fantasy Romance That Hooks You from the Start,"I was completely swept away by Sarah J. Maas's ""A Court of Thorns and Roses."" From the opening pages, I was immersed in the richly imagined world of the fae and the gripping story of Feyre, a brave and resourceful heroine. Feyre's journey from a tough huntress in the human realm to her unwilling entry into the dangerous faerie lands is thrilling and suspenseful. The author does an excellent job of slowly revealing the complex and layered world of the faeries, with its ancient feuds, shifting alliances, and hidden powers. What really makes this book shine is the character development. Feyre is a complex and relatable protagonist - tough and pragmatic on the outside, but with a well of emotion and vulnerability underneath. Her growing relationship with the enigmatic faerie lord Tamlin is by turns hostile, wary, and ultimately sizzling with chemistry. The world-building is simply stunning, with vivid descriptions that bring the faerie realm and its inhabitants to life. From the lush Spring Court to the sinister Weaver's lair, every setting is richly imagined and integral to the story. While the book starts a bit slow, it builds to an action-packed and emotionally charged climax that left me eager for the next installment. If you love fantasy romance with a strong heroine, a brooding hero, and a dash of danger, you'll be utterly enchanted by ""A Court of Thorns and Roses."" I can't wait to see what happens next!

404,"4.0 out of 5 stars A sexy fairy tale with a sweeping, epic scope","Read more:  http://www.sarcasmandlemons.com/2015/06/review-court-of-thorns-and-roses-by.html in short It seemed fitting to post my review of ACOTAR during Something Strange and Deadly week, given that Sarah and Sue are uber-besties.  I will preface by saying: I have a huge blind spot when it comes to Sarah Maas.  There were bits of this book that might have bugged me more if it had been another author.  That said, ACOTAR stands solidly on its own.  It's older than Throne of Glass, more mature, but without traipsing into drug store romance territory.  The whole atmosphere is ridiculous with magic and fairy gorgeousness.  You enter the world and immediately are steeped in its legends.  You meet Feyre, a sharp-tongued badass who taught herself archery to feed her family.  She's a firebrand and I love her.  One wrong move has her whisked away to faerie-land to live with Tamlin, sizzlingly handsome faerie Lord and certified mental eye-candy.  The relationship between them heats up slowly and burns bright.  But there's a darkness as well, a plot that threatens both of their worlds.  I wish that the evil part of the plot had been more prominent and taken up more space; I also found the ending turn a little eye-rolly.  However, I still gobbled it up.  ACOTAR transported me as a good fantasy should, and left me impatient for more. in depth in this loose beauty and the beast retelling, Meet Feyre.  Once a gentlewoman until her family's fortune was lost, she now lives with her father and two sisters in a quaint cottage.  She's the definition of fierce.  With her father a self-made invalid, her proud and idle sister Nesta, and her naive and lazy sister Elain, she's the family's sole hope.  She's scrabbled her way from starvation to survival, teaching herself to use a bow, to trade, to adapt.  So she's smart enough to recognize a fae when she sees one, and to kill it.  In a twist on the original tale, it's Feyre whose crime has brought doom, and she is given a choice: death, or life in the faerie realm, away from all she's ever known.  Obviously, she chooses the non-dead version.  She's brought to a magical castle where the Beast's curse is reimagined: masks that can never be removed, and a sickness in his magic. there are hearts at stake, It's a little less obvious why Tamlin might need a girl than the Beast, but stick with it.  You'll be rewarded with a sweet, slow-moving romance.  I'll admit: I found Tamlin a little boring.  He's broody, tortured, and has some magical rage issues that beg a nuanced dialogue around healthy relationships.  I preferred Lucien, who's witty and petulant.  But in the end, I came to appreciate Tamlin's kind and gentle nature.  His romance with Feyre is built on a rocky beginning; she hates and fears him, and longs for escape.  But of course, they come to know each other more deeply, to appreciate each other's quirks and passions.  I'd have liked more conversations between them, but we do get plenty of steaminess.  And I'll say it: I usually find sex scenes laughable, but Maas avoids ridiculous euphemisms and actually gives her steamy scenes some emotional power.  In other news, I'm hoping that the Rhys thing doesn't become a triangle thing, because unbalanced power dynamics aren't sexy. but also the fate of a magical world. Alas, the lovers cannot be in peace, for there is a curse upon the Courts of the faerie land.  Magic is becoming weaker and more unpredictable.  Dangerous creatures lurk beyond their borders, creatures that feed on fear and soul.  It soon becomes clear that the land is being corrupted from within--and its collapse could mean devastation for mankind.  Feyre isn't complacent.  She's reckless, for sure, but she's determined to find out what Tamlin can't tell her.  Along the way she meets Rhys, a seductively wicked fae lord who may be her aid--for a price.  Her curiosity leads her into a twisted game of intrigue, revenge, and evil.  It's a thrilling mystery that kept me on my toes.  It all leads up to a do-or-die moment, when Feyre must show her own power and become a savior. there are a few instances of flimsiness. I did have my issues.  ACOTAR didn't feel as tightly plotted as Throne of Glass.  Some of the character motivations seemed flimsy.  There were also few positive female characters--at least not any who stuck around for more than a few pages.  I really wanted more of Nesta and Elain, particularly as Nesta was so dynamic across the plot.  The villain, in particular, came off flat.  Not to mention a couple moments of victim blaming that made me squirmy.  But my main disappointment was with the trials Fayre faces to save Tamlin.  They were so freaking cool, but they came towards the end of the book.  As a result, they felt rushed and I felt skeptical that so much had been accomplished so soon.  Fayre does have a habit of doing crazy things that should probably kill her.  But maybe the most frown-worthy part involved a riddle.  I guessed the answer within the first two lines, so the final reveal was more meh than gasp-worthy. even so, sharp and atmospherically written, Despite these missteps, ACOTAR is a fabulous example of craft.  Maas' writing has always had a fairy tale quality to it; that's used to advantage here, where everything she describes seems extra mystical and chilling.  She's concocted a fabulous fantasy world.  Her fae are old gods, held back from ruling humanity only by an ancient treaty.  They live within seven courts--such as Dawn, Summer, and Night--that tensely coexist.  For some reason, I really geeked out about the courts.  It felt like a detail ripped from Grimm, but all Maas.  This is also a dangerous world, and I would have liked to see more of it.  There are nightmare creatures who lure you in with their seductive telepathy, goblins and ghouls, man-eating monsters who foretell the future.  It's a fairy land with a deliciously dark edge. it's the new adult we've all craved and deserved. I usually avoid new adult.  I have it on good faith that they're all much the same.  College girl meets boy.  Hatred.  Brooding.  Sexy times.  OMGLOVERAINBOWS.  It's just stupid.  But many adult books deal with marriage and kids, things I can't yet relate to.  So it's about freaking time that new adult diversified, just as young adult has done.  With ACOTAR, you get all the steam and romance, but you also get an exciting adventure story.  I can only hope that Maas' success will pave the way for other NA with actual plots. in a sentence A Court of Thorns and Roses is a fairy tale with the volume turned up: more dangerous, more romantic, more seductive.  It's yet another example of Maas' enthralling imagination. Read more",21 Jul 2015,C.J.

412,4.0 out of 5 stars Not what I normally read…no regrets,"My go to reading genre is fantasy, paranormal, romantasy, so this was out of the norm for me. I will be brutally honest, at first I cringed, dreaded picking up the book, and made excuses to not read when I normally read. I have a hard time with realistic fiction that delve into gut wrenching situations dealing with kids. They affect me deeply. I thought this was going to turn out to be like a Mystic River. But it wasn’t.  It’s a beautiful journey in the lives of these perfectly constructed, pure, heart-filled characters. It’s a story about hope and salvation. The writer weaves each person’s story together and blends them into a magnificent braided path. Even though at times I was absolutely afraid for the outcome, I read on because I was sucked into their lives and wanted to find out how it finally all concluded for them. It has a familiarity to Forrest Gump, traveling through the decades in the lives of the characters and demonstrating how every action starting from the very first page carried relevance through a lifespan. My only complaint is that there were too many unnecessary chapters or points that were droned on and repetitive. There were chapters I felt added no importance to moving the plot or characters along. This could have been shortened a bit. Overall, no regrets I veered from my norm and read this book. A book that will certainly keep you wanting to know more and leave you breathing easy and satisfied.

413,5.0 out of 5 stars Hauntingly Beautiful,"This was an easy 5 stars to grant! Set in a small town rocked by the disappearance of a young girl, All the Colors of the Dark is a dark, slow-burn mystery that mixes edge-of-your-seat tension with a heap of emotional depth. The unease and suspicion are so thick you can practically feel it as the characters try to navigate their grief and fear. The small-town vibe is nailed—everyone knows everyone, but no really knows anything. The characters are messy and flawed, but you end up caring about them anyway. Whitaker’s writing is vivid and haunting, making the tension feel real.  The pacing’s a little slow at times, but totally worth it. Whitaker peels back the layers of the mystery bit by bit, and the emotional punch adds a heavy but necessary element. If you liked Demon Copperhead or All the Ugly and Wonderful Things, you’ll love this. Bottom line: If you’re in the mood for beautiful writing, emotional upheaval and characters that stay with you, All the Colors of the Dark is a solid pick. Note:  the subject matter could be triggering for those sensitive to child abuse.

This was a well told story that was more enjoyable than many books I’ve picked up.  The only negative was the need to write to every character’s happy ending.

Whitaker is obviously a very talented writer, hopefully we can expect many more long and quiet evenings set aside to read his stories.

418,,"I was a little bit unsure early on in the book about how much I was going to enjoy it.  I liked it from the start, but felt my feelings for it 'lag' a bit for part of the first quarter of it.  Then, I'm not even sure how it happened, but it grabbed me by the heart and kept me all the way through.  I had a hard time putting it down (man, I just LOVE short chapters) and had quite a few surprises.  Great book, excellent and creative plot that was well told.

421,,"Not easy to describe the journey this book takes you on, but i will try. Having read an earlier book of the author, i knew i would enjoy his latest novel however his storytelling and settings have came a long way. For What is essentially a story of the hunt for a serial killer of young girls, the beauty in the book is remarkable. Paintings and settings so cleverly brought to life with characters so damaged yet strong its not hard to draw comparisons to the classic The Shawshank Redemption. I read this in 3 sittings which would have been 2 if not for falling asleep at 4am, phone in hand. I have two more of Mr Whittakers books to read but not until ive taken a break to fully appreciate this remarkable story. In my opinion, humble as it may be, a modern classic which i hope will be enjoyed by millions more like me for many years to come.

422,,"I loved this book! Entirely and absolutely. It started with me crying at the hairdressers and ended with me crying in bed late into the evening. Yes! It’s one of those books filled with deep characters and rich relationships that can touch you in ways you didn’t think were possible. I’ve read reviews that say it’s a slow burn at the beginning, but to stick with it because it’s brilliant. FOR ME, THOUGH, the initial first few chapters lay a beautiful foundation for a piece of work that is intense, overwhelming and mesmerising (all good things). With this being my first Chris Chitaker novel, I was concerned this book wouldn’t have enough murder/mystery vibes to suit my taste, but weaved in amongst the heightened emotions and relationships at play is a serial killer lurking in the background, changing the lives of a small town forever. I consider this book like fine wine. Do your best not to devour it all at once. It’s best absorbed slowly to allow time to breathe and absorb the beautiful relationships spanned over a lifetime.

426,5.0 out of 5 stars Spectacular!,"Many of the things you read in this book will stay with you long after you finish it. What I keep remembering is Navalny saying to the gathering crowd as he’s being arrested and dragged away is, “Never be afraid”.  This is a brave book and knowing that such a man existed among us is truly inspirational.  This book is well written, easy to read and full of the day to day life lived by Russians doomed by the thieves who run their country.

It could even be a good self-help book for those who have some mental health struggles.

431,,"If you’ve seen the Oscar-winning documentary ""Navalny"", you’re already familiar with the gripping story of the Russian opposition leader who survived poisoning by the nerve agent Novichok. This film hooks you from the start, holding your attention like a well-crafted political thriller. But since this is a documentary, the suspense isn't the work of screenwriters — everything you see actually happened. Imagine this: the president of a nuclear superpower, terrified of losing power, orders his intelligence agencies to eliminate the most prominent opposition politician. By sheer luck, the attempt fails, and the target survives. While recovering in Germany, this dissident investigates the plot against him, exposing eight agents involved in the operation. As if that weren’t enough, he pulls off a prank call to one of the agents, posing as a senior intelligence official. What follows is shocking: the agent confesses to the crime, offering a detailed account of how it all went down. The documentary culminates with Navalny’s return to Russia, fully aware that he will be arrested upon arrival — and likely killed. On February 16, 2024, the horrifying news broke: the assassination of Russia’s opposition leader had been completed. His death devastated everyone who dreamed of a democratic future for Russia. Even now, it feels unreal that such a brilliant, courageous, and charismatic figure is no longer with us. The full force of the Russian state was mobilized to prevent Navalny from becoming the opposition’s leader. The police, prosecutors, courts, and state media were all turned against him. But Navalny was always one step ahead, outsmarting those who spent public money trying to silence him. Even their first attempt to kill him failed. Patriot — as simple as it may sound — is truly a book about a patriot. Yes, we all have beliefs and political preferences. Yes, most of us love the country we were born and raised in. But how many of us would sacrifice our lives for a better future for that country? This is the essence of true patriotism: not blind loyalty, but the courage to fight for what is right, even when it means standing against injustice at the highest levels — and even when the cost is your own life. Rest in peace, Alexei. A piece of you now lives within each of us. Thank you for everything.

433,,"Alexei Navalny showed immense commitment to the values he held. His record of poisoning, persecution, and imprisonment is extremely personal and real, involving the reader intimately. He clearly had a great gift of engagement, public as well as personal. He was uncomplicated, straightforward, simple and clear, but also reflective. He offers balanced evaluations of Gorbachev, and of Yavlinsky despite Yavlinsky’s criticism of Navalny’s campaign for tactical voting. He followed his Christian convictions. He bore suffering valiantly. In all this, he made a point which will ever remain to his credit. The Putin regime’s treatment, poisoning, and likely murder of Navalny was shocking, atrocious, ruthless, unprincipled, and criminal. The system crushes the individual, their rights, and any sense of justice. This is Russia’s shame. Navalny quotes Tolstoy who wrote in ‘Resurrection’ that ‘the only suitable place for an honest man in Russia at the present time is prison’. Yet, despite this implied critique of Russians lacking his courage, Navalny disagrees, showing compassionate understanding to compromised people. Nevertheless, Russia does bear shame in its silent compromise. The saddest moments of reading Navalny’s book was looking through the photographs of his happy loving family life. A system which wantonly destroys this is not only cynical, but evil.  We can only hope that the redemption of Russian society might soon arise.

434,,"When I am reading Patriot, I can’t helping thinking about the life of the bright and brave Russian opposition leader was too short. I hope more people could read this book. His fight should be remembered. Most of the book reviews in newspapers focus on Navalny’s prison diary. The book is more than that. I have only finished the first five chapters. Navalny wrote about his childhood under the USSR, his relatives in Ukraine, the legacy of Gorbachev etc. A very large part of the book records his challenge to Putin.

435,,"A powerful narrative about a devoted, family-oriented man who, defying all odds, instilled fear in the heart of Putin and exposed an astonishing scale of corruption and criminality at the highest levels of the Russian government. Through his relentless pursuit of truth, this man became a beacon of courage and resilience. By silencing him, Putin revealed his true nature: a fearful, corrupt figure overshadowed by the legacy of the great Alexei Navalny. After reading this book, it becomes evident that while Putin is akin to a mere stone, Alexei stands as tall as Mount Everest. Rest in peace, Alexei. The world was not worthy of your strength and spirit.

438,5.0 out of 5 stars Very informative,"Shoes and tells the how and why, not just the what. So many recipe books just give the recipie and some tips. This book gives recipies with pictures and tips as well as informative overviews of basic skills like cutting an onion, what the difference between a chip, dice, mince, shred, grate, and zest is, etc. I really appriciate that it explains the fundamentals of cooking. The recipies also list what cooking utensils will be needed for the recipie and I think that’s really vital because someone not experienced in the kitchen won’t automatically know what kind of pan is for roasting or what a food processor is or even have one.

439,4.0 out of 5 stars Mostly good info - for kids of all ages - with reservations as noted! 🤔,"Basic recipes with good directions and photos. I'd have loved to have had this helpful info when I was young and trying to learn to cook by myself. It was always a joy to surprise my mom with food on the table when she got home from work, even when just a grilled cheese sandwich (made in an old pie pan under the broiler) and a can of soup I'd opened and heated on the stove!  The possibilities available in this book are a great beginning to open the imaginations of curious kids to tastes, textures, and the many rewards and confidence boost of good cooking! My only negative comment is the use of food processors and similar newer tools when a large bowl, a spoon or spatula, and some elbow grease worked fine as 'food processors' for centuries...insert eye roll here!  Also, describing to the kids how to to separate an egg USING YOUR BARE HANDS was a completely new and approaching barbaric idea I had never heard of or even thought of doing, ick!  When there are always two halves of eggshells to use from one to the other, why would anyone pour the raw egg in their hand to let all but the yolk then dribble through their fingers??  Aside from the convenient shells already in your hands, there's also an easy kitchen tool called an egg separater, yes really, that could have been shown among the kitchen tools. Much easier, less gross, and all around cleaner. Otherwise, this book and the baking book for kids are mostly recommended, except they both provide these same glaringly bogus instructions for unsuspecting children. Hmmm, maybe that was the point?? 🤓 Read more",27 Sep 2023,JANET,4.0,1492670022,"https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Cookbook-Young-Chefs/dp/1492670022/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

I went ahead and provided photos of the list of recipes in each section so you can determine if there are enough recipes your new cook will enjoy making and eating! Another thing I found amazingly helpful was the recipe stats they provide.  This can be hugely beneficial for someone who has to be very aware of specific stats in their food.

458,"5.0 out of 5 stars Gladwell Revisits Tipping Points, and looks at the dark side","Malcolm Gladwell returns by revisiting the topic of his first book: The Tipping Point.  As he states right at the beginning (pg 7) ""I want to look at the underside of the possibilites I explored so long ago.  If the world can be moved by just the slightest push, then the person who knows where and when to push has real power."" Gladwell writes the book in a style that will be familiar with anyone who has read his previous books.  He is a gifted storyteller and each facet of the argument he is trying to make is introduced with a story. (Spoilers from here on out) Summary: Gladwell tries to find the mechanisms that explain the opioid epidemic in the US (prescription and illicit drugs).  Gladwell shows how Purdue Pharma, along with guidance from the consulting firm McKinsey, leveraged certain concepts about the nature of epidemics to create the current crisis. Through the process he explores concepts including, ""small town variation,"" ""overstories""  - which he explains is his word for something resembling a Zeitgeist, revisits ""tipping points"" and monocultures among other topics. Central to his perspective is the way that stories shape our perspective, and how those who tell stories can shape the public consciousness.  He gives a number of examples that capture this vividly. Along the way he grapples with some knotty moral questions.  He explores engaging with minor discrimination to prevent vicious discrimination.  He raises the issue of better methods of identification of potentially leading to profiling disadvantaged groups (in his primary example, the COVID virus was more likely to spread from people who were elderly and overweight.)  He has an interesting perspective on Ivy League schools like Harvard using sports teams to maintain the student balance that they desire. Why should you read this book? - Gladwell is a writer who is not scared to ask big questions or explore knotty issues.  His discussions about discrimination and about the way that the introduction of Purdue's OxyContin gummies actually exacerbated the situation raises some challenging questions. - Gladwell's writing style is engaging and fun to read.  I read the book over a 24-hour period and am sure many others will do the same - Gladwell brings up anecdotes and stories that are not well known and will likely cause you to reconsider how you see things that you thought you knew. Some other notes: - Gladwell has stated at public lectures that looking back, there are aspects of his earlier writing that he no longer agrees with.  Gladwell is someone who is clearly constantly exploring and learning and is not afraid to change his perspective on topics.  I view his writing as deeply thought provoking but do not assume they are hard facts.  (In this book, I have a hard time seeing how Madden's triplicate forms would be considered an 'overstory' rather than a technical reality that impacted the drug epidemic. - Many of Gladwell's previous books have introduced ideas that were widely adopted (tipping point is just one of them), so I would expect ideas from this book to circulate pretty widely. - This book does not discuss how social media impacts public opinion.  It never mentions 'fake news,' contemporary politics, or other aspects of modern society (in 2024) that I had expected from the title. Is it for children: The book talks about Medicare fraud, drug abuse, suicide, White Flight and the Holocaust, so there are quite a few heavy topics.  I do not recall any profanity or sexual content. Conclusion: Gladwell has put out another fascinating book that spans a wide range of topics and is sure to leave you thinking.  It is a quick, engaging read, even as some of the topics are quite heavy. As with Gladwell's other books, it is sometimes hard to tell if everything seems to be tying together neatly because in fact they do, or if it is Gladwell's skill as a writer that makes it seem so.  Reviewing the notes I wrote on the book, there were aspects that I was not sure fit perfectly, though that may be an indication of the limits of my understanding of the book, rather than a flaw in the content. Overall, it is a fun read that is thought provoking.  And as noted, because Gladwell is so widely read, it seems likely that elements of this book will become widely known and shared.  Interestingly, he touches on some ideas from The Tipping Point but almost never references them directly or even acknowledges which ideas he discussed in his earlier book.

459,4.0 out of 5 stars Good but not great,"This is a revisit to the original tipping point. I wish it was either an update or entirely new. It is between both, and in my opinion misses the mark a bit. Lacks some of the conversational style of this author’s other books, which I missed. It seems kind of forced, but still presents its arguments in a clear and compelling way. That’s why I chose 4 stars. Read more",10 Oct 2024,L.

"
460,5.0 out of 5 stars Truth is in the details.,"The title of this book could have been: “The Etiology of Change.” Etiology is a medical term meaning cause. And I use it here because Gladwell, as he did in the first Tipping Point, frames change in terms of an epidemic. The tipping point, of course, is the mass at which a duality moves inevitably, and often quickly, in the other direction. It’s important because all of existence is defined by dualities. Up is always accompanied by down. Left doesn’t exist without right. And so it is with the many social trends, such as housing, college acceptance, and the opioid crisis in which there are identifiable groups of individuals which share a distinguishing common trait (e.g. race, religion, addiction) within the larger group. The objective I believe the author is seeking is how to restore balance when imbalance shows its ugly mug. The search for balance is ubiquitous to nature because of the universal existence of dualities. The topics that Gladwell addresses (e.g., Why does Harvard have a women’s rugby team?) are as obscure as those he shared in the first book. And that alone makes the book informative and entertaining. He definitely has a nose for the obscurely interesting. And, as in all his books, the research is thorough and impeccable. He does, however, spend a lot of time quoting third parties in order to build his case. Perhaps more than necessary. I personally wish he spent more time expanding his conclusions. He has a strong enough reputation that he can assume our acceptance of his source observations. His conclusion, as I read it, is that we can understand far-reaching but perplexing social trends by looking into the details. The truth, or at least the greater truth, always hides there. And if we can uncover it, we can address the problem. Resolving the problem may not always be seen as “fair,” however. The solution, as he notes, is often counter-intuitive to society’s pre-defined solutions to the problem. And that’s where the book sometimes just stops. There are few real prescriptions for how to overcome that hurdle. I suspect Gladwell considered that to be beyond the scope of the book, but it did leave me wondering, “Okay, but what do I do with that?” To me, this is a book about context. We do tend to oversimplify everything in our everyday public discourse. And certainly in this election year the oversimplification is at a fevered pitch. We’re just yelling myths at each other. The world is far more complicated and nuanced than either political party is currently acknowledging. In that regard, this book is timely although Gladwell does not enter the political fray at any level. The book is more investigative journalism than opinion piece. Gladwell is lucid and profoundly curious. The book is an easy read, and you should be able to finish the book in just a couple of days. It is worth the time.

461,5.0 out of 5 stars Another great one!,"I fell in-love with Gladwell's writing when I read ""Outliers"" many years ago. His style of writing is brilliant, it's easy for those of us who are not academics to follow along but still chock full of interesting ideas and facts. This is the sequel to, ""The Tipping Point"" and I very much enjoyed reading it. The way he was able to tie together so many things and string them along was a masterclass in writing. I found his tidbits regarding Buffalo to be interesting, having previously spent a majority of my life there and I always found the health care to be like living in a 3rd world country compared to larger cities I have lived in (Seattle, Dallas). The lack of care my own Mother received when she suffered a heart attack resulted in her death, but your mileage may vary. I digress.... it is a fantastic book and I always feel sad when I finish one of his because I enjoy his writing style so much. Hope he has many more books left in him!

469,5.0 out of 5 stars Fourth Wing,"Rebecca Yarros’ Fourth Wing is an exhilarating, emotional, and utterly captivating ride from start to finish. Set in the brutal and enchanting world of Basgiath War College, the novel delivers a perfect blend of fantasy, action, and romance that keeps readers hooked until the very last page. The story follows Violet Sorrengail, a determined and resilient young woman forced into the elite dragon riders’ quadrant, where survival is anything but guaranteed. Violet’s journey is filled with high stakes, intense challenges, and emotional turmoil, but her growth from a hesitant scholar to a fierce and capable warrior is both inspiring and gripping. Her strength is not just physical but mental and emotional, which makes her an incredibly relatable and compelling protagonist. Yarros’ world-building is rich and immersive, filled with intricate political dynamics, detailed histories, and, of course, dragons—majestic, dangerous, and intelligent creatures who steal the show. The dragon-human bond is beautifully explored, adding layers of depth to the story and introducing a fascinating magic system that feels fresh and unique. The romance between Violet and Xaden, a brooding and complex figure, is intense and full of tension. Their relationship evolves naturally amidst the chaos of their dangerous world, making it both heart-pounding and swoon-worthy. It’s not just a love story—it’s about trust, betrayal, and personal growth, all woven seamlessly into the plot. Yarros does a brilliant job of balancing action-packed scenes with quieter moments of introspection and character development. Every twist and turn keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the ending leaves you craving more, setting the stage for what promises to be an unforgettable series. Fourth Wing is a must-read for fans of fantasy, offering a perfect mix of danger, intrigue, and romance. Rebecca Yarros has crafted a masterful tale that stands out in the genre, and I can’t recommend it enough. If you love stories of resilience, complex characters, and epic dragon-filled adventures, this book will not disappoint!

470,,"Para quem ama esse universo de romantasy, Fourth Wing é uma ótima escolha. Superficialmente, é como se a autora pegasse Jogos Vorazes, As Crônicas de Gelo e Fogo, Harry Potter, ACOTAR e batesse em um liquidificador para criar essa obra. Porém, ao nos aprofundarmos na história, esquecemos essa primeira impressão, pois é notável que a Rebecca Yaros sabe escrever uma trama envolvente, que transporta o leitor para aquele universo e consegue fazê-lo sentir o que a personagem sente. Inicialmente, sobre a trama: Violet Sorrengail é a clássica heroína que se difere dos outros porque nunca quis se encaixar naquele contexto em primeiro lugar. Em uma escola dividida em quatro esquadrões - escribas, infantaria, curandeiros e montadores de dragões -, ela queria se dedicar ao primeiro, mas é forçada a ir para o último. Daí pra frente, apenas existir lá dentro se torna uma luta pela sobrevivência, pois os montadores de dragões não aceitam alguém que enfraqueça essa unidade. Lá, ela conhece Xanden Riorson, o qual é um, também clássico, anti-herói que será o interesse amoroso - e muito, muito carnal - da personagem. Ele tem tudo que amamos em um mocinho de romantasy: é lindo, é forte, chama a Violet por um apelido especial, apoia a liberdade e a liderança dela com um jeito de malvado, de perigoso, de irônico... mas tem todos os motivos do mundo pra fazer o que faz, é justo, é leal, é irresistível...e, no final das contas, completamente devoto a ela. É a receita infalível para um enemies to lovers de devorar em uma madrugada. Jogue no meio o perigo constante, ameaças mortais, dragões amedrontadores, inimigos POR TODA PARTE, uma revolução no mundo em que a protagonista vive e no jeito que ela vê as coisas e temos Fourth Wing nos prendendo à leitura como maníacas obcecadas. Claro, o livro tem defeitos: existem muitos clichês - desde bad boys vs mocinho, a garota diferente das outras garotas, protagonista superidealizada (vulgo Mary Sue/a escolhida/se errou, foi com razão) em alguns momentos, mommy e daddy issues pra todo lado -, pelo menos 1 palavrão por página (o que, em minha opinião, deixa o livro adolescente demais), e se você é apaixonada pelo Rhysand de ACOTAR, você provavelmente vai notar umas certas... semelhanças entre ele e o Xaden. Em suma, o livro cumpre o seu papel: é uma leitura divertida, te mantém interessada o tempo inteiro, te faz torcer por alguns personagens e odiar outros, te faz passar mal com as cenas hot (muito bem escritas, por sinal!), e ir correndo pro próximo livro da série só pra não nem 1 minuto de distância daquele mundo e daquele casal. Eu não diria que é super revolucionário, pois acho que esse nicho literário (fantasia com romances épicos para jovens adultos) já não tem tanto pra onde correr mais. Dito isso, cá estou eu, já terminando o segundo livro e em agonia por ter que esperar o terceiro. Enfim, recomendo!

472,,"This book is a beautiful, consuming, addicting fantasy that I wish I could read all over again for the first time!  The pacing is absolutely spot on, it includes a slow burn, enemies to lovers angsty romance that sparks right off the page, incredible but easy to follow world building and my absolute favourite trope of found family! The reader is pulled in to the breathtaking world of a war college for dragon riders, we meet Violet as she is forced to follow in her families footsteps and enter the riders quadrant, instead of becoming a scribe (a scholar).  Violet struggles with chronic pain and weak joints, I appreciated the author giving a voice to chronic conditions while demonstrating the Violet's resilience in how she overcame her bodies differences, never treating them as a disability but just as something unique. One of the greatest strengths of this book lies in its meticulous world-building.  The author creates a vivid universe, rich in intricate details that transport readers to a realm where imagination runs wild. Each setting is exquisitely described, effortlessly pulling us into the heart of the story. I could so clearly picture each individual setting in my head, it was such a unique and intriguing fantasy world.  And the dragons...I have never been so entranced by fantasy creatures in a book before! The characters are equally exceptional.  Rebecca Yarros masterfully crafts a diverse cast that is not only relatable but also leaves a lasting impression. Their strengths, vulnerabilities, and complex emotions make them feel like genuine individuals, with whom readers can form deep connections. Watching their personal journeys unfold and witnessing their growth is a true pleasure. I also loved the inclusion of LGBTQ+ characters without making them a stereotype or token character placed simply to fill a quota.  Sexual and gender identities were mentioned but never hovered on, it was a very small but heartwarming detail. I very much enjoyed how Violet's journey coming into her true powers was realistic, she wasn't automatically the strongest and best candidate, she had to work harder and smarter than the rest of the riders. Resilience is a central theme in this book. The characters face daunting challenges, both physical and emotional, and the author expertly portrays their perseverance and unwavering determination. Through their struggles, the reader is reminded of the power of the human spirit and the indomitable will to overcome even the most daunting obstacles. The plot of is an exhilarating rollercoaster ride from start to finish. Action-packed sequences and heart-stopping moments keep readers on the edge of their seats, desperate to uncover what lies around the next corner.  Rebecca Yarros skillfully balances intensity with moments of respite, allowing readers to catch their breath before plunging them back into the heart-pounding action. The intricate twists and turns keep the plot engaging, ensuring that boredom never has a chance to set in.  And when I say heart-pounding, I truly mean this, as the last action sequence had me so intensely concentrated that my apple watch gave me a warning that my heart rate was rising without any exercise occurring, I was that invested! This is an outstanding novel that deserves all the praise it has been receiving and more.  With its exceptional world-building, well-developed characters, thrilling plot, and theme of resilience, it captivated me from the very beginning.  Rebecca Yarros's skillful storytelling transports readers to a realm where imagination knows no bounds, leaving you yearning for more. Prepare to be swept away on a breathtaking journey that will leave you exhilarated and inspired.  This is a true fantasy masterpiece!!

475,5.0 out of 5 stars 5/5 Stars: Another Hilarious Adventure in the Dog Man Series!,"Dog Man: The Scarlet Shedder is the twelfth installment in Dav Pilkey’s beloved series, and it did not disappoint! My 8-year-old and I eagerly awaited this release, and it was worth every bit of the anticipation. Pros: 1. Engaging Storyline: The plot is fast-paced and full of humor, featuring Dog Man on another wild adventure. This time, he faces off against a villainous cat and deals with issues of friendship and loyalty, which makes for a fun and relatable read. 2. Fantastic Illustrations: The art is vibrant and entertaining, with Pilkey’s signature style that keeps the pages lively. The comic book format makes it easy to follow, and my child loved the dynamic panels and action sequences. 3. Positive Messages: Beyond the humor and action, the book includes great lessons about kindness, teamwork, and the importance of making good choices. It’s always refreshing to see these themes woven into a fun story. 4. Perfect for Young Readers: The language is accessible, making it ideal for early readers and reluctant ones. My child is not a huge fan of reading, but this series has truly captured their interest and has encouraged them to read more. Cons: 1. Short Length: Like the other books in the series, this one is relatively short. My child finished it quickly and was left wanting more! However, this also makes it a great choice for kids who might be intimidated by longer novels.

478,5.0 out of 5 stars A Page-Turner for Dog Man Fans,"Dog Man: The Scarlet Shedder is another hit in the popular Dog Man series. My 10-year-old son has read it five times and ranks it as his third favorite in the series. He loves the hardcover edition and keeps it on his bookshelf as a collectible. The story is engaging and full of humor, typical of the Dog Man series. My son finds it hard to put down and often reads late into the night, even with a flashlight. While I appreciate his enthusiasm, I have to occasionally remind him about bedtime. Overall, Dog Man: The Scarlet Shedder is a fantastic choice for young readers who enjoy graphic novels. It's a fun and exciting adventure that will keep kids entertained for hours.

501,5.0 out of 5 stars More pigeon-created drama. Perfect for reading aloud!,"Mo Willems hits it out of the park again. The pigeon once again wants to drive something. This time it's a sleigh. As in previous volumes, he begs and pleads before throwing a temper tantrum. Once he calms down though, he takes a closer look at the sleigh and realizes their is no clutch or steering wheel. The last straw pokes it's nose onto the page sending pigeon fleeing. The humor shines through as the pigeon learns once again that sometimes things aren't exactly what we expect them to be and desires can change. But has he actually learned his lesson? I don't think so judging by the twist at the end. Mo Willems has a knack for creating books that are a delight to read and make numerous readers laugh both young and old. Perfect for reading aloud with it's simple yet perfectly designed text. The use of a variety of fonts gives readers clues about how to read it. It's simply impossible not to become the pigeon as one reads. The illustrations are bright and eye-catching. It never ceases to amaze me the way he conveys so much emotion with simple lines and shapes. Young readers and writers may even want to create their own pigeon stories. A great read aloud for the holiday season and all year.

503,5.0 out of 5 stars Fun for all ages and encourages kids to read!,"My daughters (7 year old twins and 3 year old) and I are obsessed with Mo Willems' books. My twins started memorizing his books when they were 2 years old, so of course we were very excited for a new Pigeon book! That persuasive pigeon is always up to something! I love the story. It's like the others, but unpredictable, so it was so much fun to read and I'm looking forward to reading it many more times. There's also a little ""Easter egg"" hidden on the page with the fireplace, and my daughters noticed it right away! I just saw stockings at first, but they knew! I don't want to spoil it for Mo Willems fans, so that's all I'll say. ;) And the ending really made me hopeful for another Pigeon book. I sure hope he'll write more, because we love them! It's another cute book, but what I love most about Mo Willems' books is that they're enjoyable no matter how old you are and they're educational. Toddlers love the silly characters and their lines, which they quickly memorize, and then that encourages them to read. One of my twins was reluctant to practice reading sometimes, but she was always in the mood for Pigeon or Elephant and Piggie books. They really helped with her confidence. Both of them started reading chapter books last year, but we'll always enjoy Mo Willems' books. Of course I got ""Be the Bus,"" which is targeted towards adults, too. I definitely recommend this book for any age and it would make a wonderful Christmas gift! We just couldn't wait until then and had to read it now. :) Read more",06 Sep 2023,TwinMommy,5.0,1454952776,"https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Let-Pigeon-Drive-Sleigh/dp/1454952776/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

514,5.0 out of 5 stars Compelling,"Michael Connelly is a must buy, must read author. This stand-alone is easy to follow. No editing errors, gratuitous violence or drag-you-down drama.  Not all questions are answered. Intriguing storyline about cold cases, trying to solve them, the always dangerous “office” politics and criminals.  Descriptive writing that draws the reader into each scene. Realistic procedures, actions and reactions. Believable characters with distinct personalities and emotional baggage. Thought-provoking and memorable dialogue. “You’ll learn this: Part of being a good detective is knowing your boss and how he thinks.” “Or how she thinks.” “Right. Your dad can tell you a lot about all of this.” “Uh, I don’t think my dad did too well in supervisor psychology.” “True.” “I mean, he threw a lieutenant through a glass window in the watch office once. They still talk about that at Hollywood Division.” “Then I’ll let you go. But remember, Ballard, think before you act. There are consequences. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The laws of politics are the same as the laws of physics.” I will re-read this story and always look forward to, pre-order when possible, new works by this author.

515,5.0 out of 5 stars Connelly is Still Back.  Great Book,"I enjoyed the book.  Well written and engaging.  Reasonable well developed and likable characters. The story line is kept moving because several investigations are developed simultaneously.  As one naturally slows, the story shifts to one of the other investigations.  This is 90% Renee.  Harry Bosch has only a walk on presence.  Connolly is obviously grooming Harry’s daughter Maddie for larger roles  I debated giving it 4 stars.  The investigations are interesting but, somewhat superficial.  But the story is so well written, it just keeps you engaged and satisfied.

516,4.0 out of 5 stars Renee is No Harry,"I've read every Connelly book three times and couldn't wait to devour yesterday's release. Lesson learned: Renee Ballard is very different from Harry, although they do share a tendency to defy the rules and lone-wolf their way around LAPD. However, Harry to me is soulful, intuitive, thoughtful and, yes, depressed a lot of the time. Renee, to me, comes across as immature, a bit hysterical and dramatic, and not exactly intuitive in the ways of a savvy officer. I didn't love the book -- and Maddie was even worse. Sadly, I won't be buying any more of MC's books if Renee is the protagonist. If only she had just been created as a little shrewder and a little better suited to the job. Disappointed -- probably the only person on the planet who feels this way, so I apologize. It WAS a great procedural, though.

"
517,"5.0 out of 5 stars Wild Plotting, But Should Be Ranked As One Of The Books Of The Year","Of course this is a wonderful book.  Michael Connelly is a top-five crime writer, a master of his craft.  He knows L.A. like the back of his hand and he represents it (and its travel times) realistically.  He has created iconic characters; he takes on significant themes and he can plot with exquisite skill. Two things concerning this book should be noted.  First, this is not really a ‘Ballard and Bosch novel’ so much as a Ballard and Bosch family novel.  Harry appears very briefly in the book (though at important moments), perhaps 5% of it.  His daughter Maddie joins Ballard’s cold case group (in important ways) for about 20% of the book.  This is not a criticism; it is simply a matter of truth in advertising. Second: the plot.  There are actually three plots.  Ballard’s team is searching for a serial rapist, primarily through DNA evidence.  Second, Ballard’s badge and gun are stolen while she is surfing and she must recover them or face threats of seeing her unit dissolved and herself transferred to far more trivial and far less interesting duty.  Finally (and this is the wild wrinkle), Maddie approaches Ballard with evidence of the identity of the murderer of the Black Dahlia, Elizabeth Short.  This titanic discovery is presented with a modern twist: the politicized D.A. refuses to prosecute (i.e. close the case, since the perp is long dead) because the chief of police backed a different candidate in his election and he values his personal spite over the public’s need to know and the remaining families of the other victims’ thirst for justice. The evidence for the identification of the Dahlia’s murderer turns on a relatively new technique, which involves the precise measurements of the elements of a person’s ear (more precise than fingerprint evidence).  This gives MC the opportunity to show his (very considerable) procedural chops. While the plotting is ‘different’ and totally unexpected it is also engaging and memorable. Bottom line: it is hard to rank a MC novel because the quality is always there.  I can only say that this should be ranked as one of the books of the year for 2024.  An easy 5 stars.

519,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Read!,"This is my first Michael Connelly book.  I read a review in the local paper and decided to give it a try.  So glad I did.  Found Mr. Connelly's writing style to be natural and concise.  Had an immediate liking towards protagonist Renee Ballard and did care about what would happen to her.  All of the team members of the Unsolved Cases Unit of the LAPD were believable and well-described.  Loved that they were unpaid volunteers.  What a great service to provide to the police department as a concerned citizen.  All that, along with the short chapters and descriptions of places made for an enjoyable page-turner.  ""The Waiting"" is #6 in the Ballard series.  I immediately went online and ordered numbers 1, 2 and 3.  So I have catching up to do!  Highly recommend this series!

520,,"I like the Renee Ballard character and pairing her with Harry Bosch makes for an exciting read.  There is a solid plot, and Renee has to reach out to Harry for his help while putting up with the interference and bad treatment of her bosses.  All the ingredients from the previous books are there, and we see Harry using all his contacts and skills to help Renee with her investigation. Michael Connelly has written these characters with so much depth and character that we feel we know them personally.

I read this to my 6 month old granddaughter and she followed along paying close attention to the pictures and even helped turned the page so I could keep reading.  When her mother read it to her, she did the same but with much more enthusiasm. Well worth the price. The book itself had a few minor dings in it, probably from shipping.
